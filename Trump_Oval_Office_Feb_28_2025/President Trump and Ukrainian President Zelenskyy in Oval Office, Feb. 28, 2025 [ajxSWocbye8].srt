1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,600
The President, thank you very much.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,740
It's an honor to have President Zelensky of Ukraine.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,340
And we've been working very hard, very close.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,380
So we've actually known each other for a long time.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,720
We've been dealing with each other for a long time

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,640
and very well.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,060
We had a little negotiation spat,

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,080
but that worked out great, I think, for both countries.

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,600
I think for the world, actually, beyond both countries.

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,060
And we have something that is a very fair deal.

11
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,960
And we look forward to getting in and digging,

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,440
digging, digging, and working

13
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,300
and getting some of the rare earth.

14
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,860
But it means we're going to be inside.

15
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,240
And it's a big commitment from the United States.

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,740
And we appreciate working with you very much.

17
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,840
And we will continue to do that.

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,340
We have had some very good discussions with Russia.

19
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,780
I spoke with President Putin.

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,060
And we're going to try and bring this to a close.

21
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,880
It's something that you want and that he wants.

22
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,060
We have to negotiate a deal.

23
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,300
But we've started the confines of a deal.

24
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,860
And I think something can happen.

25
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,960
The big thing is the number of soldiers,

26
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,280
mostly at this point, but soldiers being killed.

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,000
You're losing thousands of soldiers.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
On both sides, we're losing a lot of soldiers.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,480
And we want to see it stop.

30
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,780
And we want to see the money get put to different kinds of use,

31
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,280
like rebuilding, the rebuilding.

32
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,880
And we're going to be working very hard.

33
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,160
But we've had a lot of very good conversations.

34
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,840
I will say until we came along, the Biden administration

35
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,840
didn't speak to Russia whatsoever.

36
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
They didn't speak to anybody.

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,740
They just allowed this to continue.

38
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,640
And I will say that I'll say in front of you,

39
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,740
you've heard me say it a thousand times.

40
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,080
If I were President, this war would have never happened.

41
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,920
We would have had a deal negotiated for you

42
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,860
without having to go through what you've gone through.

43
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,220
But you, your soldiers have been unbelievably brave.

44
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,560
We've given them great equipment,

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,360
but they've, somebody has to use the equipment.

46
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,240
They've been unbelievably brave.

47
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,860
And we give them great credit.

48
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,480
This was supposed to be over very quickly.

49
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,700
And here we are three years later.

50
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,740
So I give tremendous credit to your generals

51
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,580
and your soldiers and yourself in the sense

52
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,420
that it's been very hard fighting, very tough fighting.

53
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,280
They're great fighters.

54
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,460
And you have to be very proud of them from that standpoint.

55
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,460
But now we want to get it over with.

56
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,820
It's enough, right, if we want to get it over with.

57
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,560
So it's an honor to have you here.

58
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,760
Thank you very much for coming.

59
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,260
We're going to sign the agreement at the conference

60
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,640
in the East Room in a little while, right after lunch.

61
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,060
And we'll be having lunch together.

62
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,040
We're also discussing some other things.

63
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
And we appreciate everybody being here.

64
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,580
It's a, somewhat of an exciting moment.

65
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,500
But the really exciting moment is when we get a,

66
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,920
when they stop the shooting and we end up with a deal.

67
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,780
And I think we're fairly close to getting that.

68
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,980
And an honor to have you.

69
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,480
And please, would you like to say something?

70
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,620
The President Trump Jr.: No, thank you so much,

71
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,620
Mr. President.

72
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,760
Thank you for your invitation.

73
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,960
And really, I hope that this document, first document,

74
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,100
will be a first step to real security guarantees for Ukraine,

75
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,100
our people, our children.

76
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,800
I really count on it.

77
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,580
And of course, we count that America will not stop support.

78
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,720
Really, for us, it's very important to support

79
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,320
and to continue it.

80
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,520
I want to discuss it with details further during our conversation

81
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,920
and, of course, the infrastructure or security guarantees.

82
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,720
Because for today, I understand what Europe is ready to do.

83
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,520
And of course, I want to discuss with you what United States

84
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,260
will be ready to do.

85
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,340
And I really count on your strong position to stop Putin.

86
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,540
And you said that enough with the war.

87
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,680
I think that is very important, Ben, to say these words to Putin

88
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
at the very beginning.

89
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,020
At the very beginning of war, because he's a killer and terrorist.

90
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,980
But I hope that together we can stop him.

91
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:06,780
But for us, it's very important to save our country, our values,

92
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,480
our freedom and democracy.

93
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,260
And of course, no compromises with the killer about our territories.

94
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,000
But it will be later.

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,660
And of course, what I wanted, you know we spoke about it by phone

96
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,900
with you about the drones production.

97
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,560
We have very good drones production.

98
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,340
I think the best one in the world for today because of the war.

99
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,320
Yes, and of course, we need very much the air defense.

100
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,480
You have the best air defense in the world.

101
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,780
And really, you helped us under attacks of Russians.

102
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,160
And I want to speak how we can exchange the licenses.

103
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,120
We're open to share the licenses of all our drones with you,

104
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,460
of course, with the United States.

105
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,900
And we need licenses for quick production of air defense.

106
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,060
Even after the war, we need our nation to be calm,

107
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,100
that we are secure.

108
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,740
So that's why we need this air shield.

109
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,640
And of course, about this, I want to speak about the contingents.

110
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,580
I think that France and UK already spoke to you.

111
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,840
And we know that Europe is ready, but without the United States,

112
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,580
they will not be ready to be as strong as we need.

113
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,960
And the last point, last not least, about exchange,

114
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,200
about our people and children.

115
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,180
And you know that this crazy Russian that they've stolen 20,000 of children,

116
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,000
Ukrainian children, they changed their names.

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,480
They changed their, you know, their families, relatives.

118
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,520
And now they're in Russia.

119
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,520
We want to bring them back.

120
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,360
And really, it's a big, big dream, task and goal for me.

121
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,400
And our warriors, we, by the way, Mr. President, we brought,

122
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,240
we exchanged, we, yes, released more than 4,000 warriors

123
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,000
from Russian prison, but there are thousands more in the prison.

124
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,280
I wanted to share with you some, some images, how, how,

125
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,840
just, just, can I, can I now?

126
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,120
Yeah, please, please.

127
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,320
One minute, one minute, just you to understand what, in what circumstances,

128
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,840
in what situation they are, and what the attitude of Russia to our prisons.

129
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,700
That, guys, just you, before, before and after.

130
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,000
And you see, before and after, just you to understand.

131
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,440
Now, thousands of such guys, ladies and men, there.

132
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,120
And that, so they don't eat, they beat them, and they, you know,

133
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,520
they do a lot of, a lot of, you know, bad things.

134
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,960
So, out of, even during the war, there are rules.

135
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,520
Everybody knows, there are rules during the war.

136
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,000
These guys, they don't have any rules, you see that.

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
50, 60 kilograms left, and a lot of such things.

138
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,240
And I didn't want to show you what, what the changes with images of children,

139
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,040
because I will share, just share with you.

140
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,320
And, I mean, it's looking tragic.

141
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,720
Yep, that's tough stuff.

142
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,160
Yeah, yeah, I wanted very much to, to give you, and you, you see.

143
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,760
Yeah.

144
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,460
This is pastor, by the way.

145
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,260
They stolen pastors, because it's not Russian church.

146
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,600
They stolen pastors and moved pastors to the prison.

147
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,360
We, at the end of last year, we, we brought three pastors,

148
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,660
and we, we could exchange them.

149
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,260
This is pastor, you see.

150
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,740
Yeah, that's tough.

151
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,560
Yeah, so, I mean, this, I wanted to show you, and this.

152
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,900
So, thank you very much.

153
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,180
We want to get that ended, right?

154
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,140
Yeah, yeah, of course, we, of course, we want to.

155
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,980
And I think we will.

156
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,580
I think we will.

157
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,380
And, uh...

158
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,720
We have to, of course.

159
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,940
Do you have any questions, please?

160
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,080
When you continue, to ask you about, Mr. President,

161
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,880
just a quick question.

162
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,080
Thank you, Mr. President.

163
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,620
We think that, how much money is the U.S.

164
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,020
going to put into the fund that is being created today?

165
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,620
And how does this provide long-term security for Ukraine?

166
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,360
Well, we don't know exactly how much,

167
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,460
because we're going to be putting some money in a fund

168
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,660
that we're going to get from the raw earth

169
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,400
that we're going to be taking and sharing in terms of revenue.

170
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,540
So, it's going to be a lot of money will be made

171
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,140
from the sale and from the use of raw earth.

172
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,980
And, as you know, our country doesn't have much raw earth.

173
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,680
We have a lot of oil and gas,

174
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,520
but we don't have a lot of the raw earth.

175
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,020
And what we do have is protected by the environmentalists,

176
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,360
but that could be unprotected.

177
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,960
But still, it's not very much.

178
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,060
They have among the best in the world, in terms of raw earth.

179
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,700
So, we're going to be using that, taking it,

180
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,540
using it for all of the things we do,

181
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:40,280
including AI and including weapons and the military.

182
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,720
And it's really going to very much satisfy our needs.

183
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,820
So, something that just worked out really well.

184
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,780
We have a lot of oil and we have a lot of gas.

185
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,680
We have a lot, but we don't have raw earth.

186
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,680
So, this has just about every component of the raw earth

187
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,360
that we need for computers, for all of the things we do.

188
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,620
This puts us in great shape.

189
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,620
The Press Presser and the long-term security program.

190
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,620
How is this provided?

191
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,360
The President Biden I think they're going to have great long.

192
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,740
I think once we make the agreement,

193
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,500
that's going to be 95 percent of it.

194
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,440
It's, they're not going to go back to fighting.

195
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,640
I've spoken with President Putin.

196
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,340
And I think, I mean, I feel very strong.

197
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,080
I've known them for a long time.

198
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,440
And I feel very strongly that they're very serious about it.

199
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,580
And we'll make a deal.

200
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,640
And when the deal is made, I don't think,

201
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,780
we talk about security.

202
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,180
Everyone's talking about the other day,

203
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,460
all they talked about was security.

204
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,580
I said, let me make the deal first.

205
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,800
I have to make the deal first.

206
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,260
I don't worry about security right now.

207
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,100
I have to, we have to have a deal.

208
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,640
Because right now, last week, 2,000 soldiers died on both sides.

209
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,920
2,000 and they're losing 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 a week.

210
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,380
So as we sit here and we talk,

211
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,920
people are getting shot and dying on the battlefield.

212
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,360
And you know, they're not American soldiers,

213
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,620
but they're Russian soldiers and they're Ukrainian soldiers.

214
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,060
And we want to be able to stop it.

215
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,960
And we want to be able also to spend money on other things.

216
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,560
We don't want to, this is a tremendous amount of money.

217
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,200
And what the Biden administration did was terrible.

218
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,840
They were giving money, but he had no security on the money.

219
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,000
Europe, as you know, gave much less money,

220
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,940
but they had security.

221
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,840
It was in the form of a loan.

222
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,280
They get their money back and we didn't.

223
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,180
And now, at least we're protected

224
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,740
because the American taxpayer has to be protected too.

225
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:28,820
But this is an incredible agreement for Ukraine

226
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,260
because we have a big investment in their country now.

227
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,400
And what they have, very few people have.

228
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,600
And we're able to really go forward with very,

229
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,840
very high-tech things and many other things,

230
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,400
including weaponry.

231
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,480
Weaponry that we're going to use in many locations,

232
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,680
but that we need for our country.

233
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,820
This allows us to do this.

234
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,980
The President, will you continue?

235
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,980
The President, will you continue?

236
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,980
The President, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

237
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,920
I can't get in.

238
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,420
The President, military aid.

239
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,560
The President, yes, go ahead, please.

240
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,360
The President, if I can just add, yes.

241
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,560
In the document, there is one of the very important points.

242
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,400
If we speak about business and investment,

243
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,960
we never had LNG terminals in Ukraine.

244
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,260
This document will open.

245
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,600
I mean, the next document, but anyway,

246
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,980
here we see in the framework,

247
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,840
we see a really good will for this.

248
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,040
LNG terminals for us is very important,

249
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,820
and I think for security of European continent.

250
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,020
We have the biggest storage, gas storage.

251
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,480
We have the biggest in Europe, yes, and we can use it.

252
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,420
UGIS for LNG, use it for LNG, and we will do it.

253
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,760
And really, we can help Europe,

254
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,220
because Europe really helped.

255
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,160
President Trump said that they made less support.

256
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,200
But they have our friends,

257
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,100
and they are our very supportive partners.

258
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,960
They really gave a lot, Mr. President.

259
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,640
They really, they did.

260
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,500
The President, I think, I think.

261
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,300
The President, they gave a lot, but they gave much less.

262
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,500
No.

263
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,100
The President, much less.

264
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,100
No.

265
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,100
No.

266
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,440
The President, don't argue with them.

267
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
No.

268
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
Okay.

269
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
Okay.

270
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,440
The President, can you, can you, can you please?

271
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,440
Yeah, please.

272
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,260
Mr. President Trump, you have repeatedly called

273
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,920
the deal with Ukraine as a historical one.

274
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,300
And as the President of the United States,

275
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,760
you make historical decisions in other issues,

276
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,660
which affect America and other worlds.

277
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,660
So, what place in the world history do you want to take?

278
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:38,480
And do you associate yourself with any famous historical figures?

279
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,480
The President, I'd say George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.

280
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,040
I would say I'm far superior to George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.

281
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,040
Now, you know I'm only kidding, right?

282
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,040
Because when I say that, the fake news is going to go wild.

283
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,040
They're going to say he considers himself to be better than Washington.

284
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,040
But you never know.

285
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,040
You never know.

286
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,040
I don't compare myself to anybody.

287
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,040
I just, I'm here to do a job.

288
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,040
We've had a great 35 days or whatever it might be, a month, a little more than a month.

289
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,040
We've accomplished tremendous amounts.

290
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:17,040
Not only this, this would be a very great achievement if we could get the war stopped and get them back to normalization.

291
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,040
I think that's going to happen.

292
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,040
We've had very good talks on both sides, as you know.

293
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,040
But I think we've done a very good job, just generally.

294
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:31,040
If you look at all of the things we've done in 30 days, they're saying there's never been an opening for a President.

295
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,040
The first month, there's never been a first month like we've had.

296
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,040
And this is one of the very important things.

297
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:44,040
This, to me, is one of the most important things, because we have tremendous death taking place as we speak.

298
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,040
And I don't want to have that.

299
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,040
You know, think of the parents.

300
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,040
Think of the parents.

301
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,040
Whether they're in Russia or Ukraine, think of the parents of all these people being killed, needlessly.

302
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
They came to our territory.

303
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,040
Should have never started.

304
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,040
This would have, if I were President, this would have never started.

305
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:07,040
Mr. President, will you continue sending military aid?

306
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:13,040
To Ukraine after the U.S. signed this agreement with Ukraine?

307
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
Yeah, we're going to be continuing.

308
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
And the question to President Zelensky.

309
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,040
Do you feel like the U.S. is on your side?

310
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,040
That the President Trump is on your side at this, at this moment?

311
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,040
Go ahead.

312
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,040
What do you think?

313
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,040
He wants to know, do you think that, sort of a stupid question.

314
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,040
Because I guess we wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

315
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:53,040
But I think that the United States, on our side from the very beginning of occupation, and I think that President Trump on our side, and of course, I'm sure that the United States President will not stop support.

316
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,040
This is crucial for us.

317
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,040
It's important for us.

318
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,040
Yes.

319
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,040
And Putin, the President speaks about the people and the soldiers which are dying.

320
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,040
But they came to our territory.

321
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,040
They came to our land.

322
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,040
They began this war, and they have to stop.

323
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:12,040
And I think this is the question with really the most important question.

324
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:24,040
Can President Trump, I hope yes, with some other allies, to stop Putin, withdraw these enemies, our enemies, withdraw these troops from our land?

325
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,040
And I think that you asked about the history.

326
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,040
I think that if President Orwell, he will stop Putin.

327
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:38,040
If President Trump will bring peace to our country, I think he will be on this wall.

328
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,040
We've had very, very good talks.

329
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,040
What about military aid to Ukraine?

330
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,040
President Zelenskyy just said there would be no compromises with Vladimir Putin.

331
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,040
I just wanted to ask both of you.

332
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:59,040
Firstly, are there compromises that you think that President Zelenskyy is going to have to make?

333
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,040
And, President Zelenskyy, is there anything that you might be thinking that you may be able to offer or bring to the table?

334
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,040
For example, elections?

335
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,040
Thank you.

336
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,340
I think you're going to have to always make compromises.

337
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,720
You can't do any deals without compromises.

338
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,020
So, certainly, he's going to have to make some compromises.

339
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,660
But hopefully, they won't be as big as some people think

340
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,760
you're going to have to make.

341
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,260
That's all.

342
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,080
It's all we can do.

343
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,500
I'm here as an arbitrator, as a mediator, to a certain

344
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,660
extent, between two parties that have been very hostile.

345
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,460
To put it mildly, they've been very hostile.

346
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,760
There's been a vicious war.

347
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,140
There's been a vicious war.

348
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,840
You know, it's a very level battlefield.

349
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,400
And those bullets go out.

350
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,040
And as I've said many times, we were talking about it with

351
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,820
Pete, many times the only thing stopping those bullets

352
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,580
is a human body.

353
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,460
And in the case we're talking about generally young human

354
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,680
bodies are stopping a lot of bullets.

355
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,760
It's dead level.

356
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,460
That's why it's great farmland.

357
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,420
It's great land.

358
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,300
It's great farmland.

359
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,160
But there's very little protection against the

360
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,260
bullets that are being and other things that are being

361
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,400
shot.

362
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,840
So all I can do is see if I can get everybody at

363
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,400
the table and get an agreement.

364
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,980
And I think we're going to end up with an agreement.

365
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,220
Otherwise, I wouldn't probably be even here today.

366
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,620
The Pressure

367
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,620
The Pressure

368
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,620
The Pressure

369
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,620
The Pressure

370
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,620
The Pressure

371
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,620
The Pressure

372
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,620
The Pressure

373
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,080
The Pressure

374
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,360
The Pressure

375
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,260
The Pressure

376
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,460
The Pressure

377
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,400
The Pressure

378
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,460
The Pressure

379
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,400
The Pressure

380
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,320
I hope it will.

381
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,400
I mean, I hope I'm going to be remembered as a peacemaker.

382
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,140
This is, this would be a great thing if we could do this.

383
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,900
I'm doing this to save lives more than anything else.

384
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,640
Second is to save a lot of money.

385
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,640
But I've considered that to be far less important.

386
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,720
So I hope I'm going to thank you, Brian, for that question.

387
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,680
It was a nice question.

388
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,420
I hope I'll be known and recognized as a peacemaker.

389
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,320
This, this would be a great thing to solve.

390
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,460
This is a very dangerous situation.

391
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,820
You know, this could lead to a third world war.

392
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,260
This is, this was headed in the wrong direction.

393
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,860
If this election were lost, if we didn't win this election,

394
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,660
and by, we won it by a lot.

395
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,600
That was a mandate.

396
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,020
We won every swing state.

397
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,300
We won the popular vote by millions and millions of votes.

398
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,100
We won everything.

399
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,240
The districts, you, you look at the areas of, of red.

400
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,440
Take a look at a map.

401
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,700
This was a big mandate.

402
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,040
And this was one of the things I said,

403
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,240
we're going to get this thing settled.

404
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,320
If we didn't win, I think this would have,

405
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,980
this could have very well ended up in a third world war.

406
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,360
And that would not, that would not have been a good situation.

407
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,420
What was your second question?

408
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,420
My second question for President Zelensky.

409
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,420
No.

410
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,520
Do you ever, why don't you wear a suit?

411
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,520
Why?

412
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,520
Sir?

413
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
Why don't you wear a suit?

414
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,120
You're the highest level in this country's office,

415
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,960
and you refuse to wear a suit in this country's office,

416
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,960
and you refuse to wear a suit?

417
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,960
You own a suit?

418
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,800
Yeah, you have problems.

419
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,640
A lot of Americans have problems with you.

420
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,300
Really?

421
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,380
I don't have such.

422
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,280
I will wear a costume after this war will finish.

423
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,140
Yes, maybe, maybe something like yours, yes.

424
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,980
Maybe some, something better, I don't know.

425
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,980
We will see.

426
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,080
Maybe something cheaper than, yeah.

427
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,080
Thank you.

428
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,080
Thank you.

429
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,080
Thank you, President.

430
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,080
Thank you, President.

431
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,360
You said, Mr. President, are you going to send more arms

432
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,560
to Ukraine in case there's no peace?

433
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,500
Yeah, we're going to have arms to Ukraine, yeah, sure.

434
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Hopefully I won't have to send very much because

435
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,440
hopefully we're going to have it finished.

436
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,900
We're looking forward to finishing this quickly.

437
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,240
We're not looking forward to sending a lot of arms.

438
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,080
We're looking forward to getting the war finished so

439
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,080
we can do other things.

440
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,020
But we very much appreciate the agreement because we

441
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,720
needed what they had, and we're treating, you know,

442
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,380
our country is now treated fairly.

443
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,360
Biden didn't do that.

444
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,400
Biden didn't, he didn't know what the hell he was doing.

445
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
This should have never happened.

446
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,100
This should have never started.

447
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,100
But, you know, sure, the answer is yes, but hopefully

448
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,600
we won't have to send much because I'm looking forward

449
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,480
to get it done, getting it done quickly, very quickly.

450
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,320
Does that still provide security guarantees,

451
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,820
Mr. President?

452
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,920
I don't want to talk about security yet because I

453
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,020
want to get the deal done.

454
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,320
You know, you fall into the same trap like everybody

455
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,260
else a million times you said over and over, I want to

456
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,300
get the deal done, security is so easy.

457
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,000
That's about 2 percent of the problem.

458
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,440
I'm not worried about security.

459
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,740
I'm worried about getting the deal done.

460
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,340
The security is the easy part.

461
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,700
Security is very nice.

462
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,480
Everybody stop shooting.

463
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,040
And now, will Europe put people there?

464
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,880
I know France is going to.

465
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,920
I know the UK is going to.

466
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,920
I know other countries are going to, and they happen

467
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,280
to be right next door.

468
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,360
We haven't committed, but we could conceivably.

469
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,760
You know, we have security in a different form.

470
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,100
We'll have workers there digging, digging, digging,

471
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,860
taking the raw earth so that we can create a lot of

472
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,640
great product in this country.

473
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,240
So, in that sense, you have something.

474
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,240
But we haven't determined that yet.

475
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,380
I will say, in speaking to France and in speaking to

476
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,320
the, and they were here, as you know, last week and

477
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:07,080
just the other day, they have committed to a lot of security.

478
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,660
I don't think you're going to need much security.

479
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,260
I think once this deal gets done, it's over.

480
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,640
Russia is not going to want to go back and nobody's

481
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,840
going to want to go back.

482
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,500
When this, when this deal ends, I really believe this

483
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,640
deal is, is going to be over.

484
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,980
Question.

485
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,540
Yeah.

486
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,300
Please go ahead.

487
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,080
Go ahead, please.

488
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,480
Yeah.

489
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,680
The Press, President, thank you.

490
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,580
The Press, President, thank you.

491
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,840
The Press, President Macron and Keir Starmer at the

492
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,220
White House this past week, both whom praised your

493
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,080
courage and conviction to lead the pathway towards peace.

494
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,760
The Press, President Macron and Keir Starmer

495
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,580
Thank you.

496
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,580
Part of that involved, though, reengaging with Russia

497
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,760
in diplomatic relations, something that previous leaders

498
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,420
lack the conviction to do so.

499
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,500
What gave you the moral courage and conviction

500
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,860
to step forward and lead that?

501
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,860
The President Biden Well, I love this guy.

502
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,800
Who are you with?

503
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,700
The Press 1 American News, sir.

504
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,340
The President Biden Well, that's why I like him.

505
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,180
One American News does a great job.

506
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,180
It's very, I like the question.

507
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,900
I think it's a very good question.

508
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,180
It is, it's a pathway to peace.

509
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,480
It's a pathway to getting something solved.

510
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,560
And I feel that as the head of this country,

511
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,420
I have an obligation to do that.

512
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,660
Plus, you know, we're very much involved.

513
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,160
We got involved.

514
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,160
It's too bad we got involved because there should have

515
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,700
been no involvement because there should have been no war.

516
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,060
And there shouldn't have been October 7th.

517
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,180
That would have never happened.

518
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,980
As you know, Iran was broke.

519
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,880
They had no money to give to Hezbollah.

520
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,180
They had no money to give to Hamas.

521
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,480
They were stone cold broke.

522
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,640
And then under Biden, they became rich as hell.

523
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,820
They went from no money to $300 billion in a period

524
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,480
of four years.

525
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,080
And they gave a lot of that money away.

526
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,120
And you see what happened.

527
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,560
And that's a real mess also that we hope to be able to solve.

528
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,420
But, no, I appreciate your question very much.

529
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:48,460
I just, I feel I have an obligation to try and do

530
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,960
something to stop the death.

531
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,660
The President Trump Jr.: If I can, if I can answer.

532
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,860
Yes, if I can answer.

533
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,660
The President Trump Jr.: Please, go ahead.

534
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,940
The President Trump Jr.: Please, please.

535
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,440
The President Trump Jr.: And I do like your clothing, by the way.

536
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,300
The President Trump Jr.: Yeah, really?

537
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,400
The President Trump Jr.: Even though I have to,

538
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,980
I think he's a great guy, by the way.

539
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,780
The President Trump Jr.: And I don't know if you two like

540
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,580
each other.

541
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,520
But you know what?

542
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,020
The President Trump Jr.: I think he's dressed beautiful.

543
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,760
I like this guy.

544
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,260
I don't like him.

545
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,060
The President Trump Jr.: I think he's dressed beautifully.

546
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,800
The President Trump Jr.: So I have more serious things than

547
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,700
answer on such question.

548
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,520
The President Trump Jr.: That's true.

549
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,700
The President Trump Jr.: I will answer on more serious

550
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,920
questions if I can.

551
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,460
The President Trump Jr.: That's a good statement.

552
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,100
The President Trump Jr.: Yeah.

553
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,100
So, please.

554
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,900
about security guarantees and about justice fire.

555
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,180
We can't just speak about this fire and speak and speak.

556
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,680
It will not work.

557
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,940
Justice fire will not never work

558
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,980
because I'm like a president.

559
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,180
I have this experience and not only me.

560
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,560
Ukraine, before my presidency from the 2014,

561
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,120
Putin broken 25 times.

562
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,620
25 times he broken his own signature.

563
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,520
Twenty-five times he broken his fire.

564
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,060
But he never broke to me.

565
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:50,800
He never broke to me.

566
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,400
No, no, you were the president.

567
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,360
He never broke to me.

568
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,540
In 2016, you've been the president, Mr. President.

569
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:01,240
You've been the president, but he had, of course, not with you,

570
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,500
but he had, during those periods,

571
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,980
he had conversations with our side,

572
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,040
and we had Normandy format, you know,

573
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,340
the France, Germany, Ukraine, and Russia,

574
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,380
and he broken 25 times.

575
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,380
That's why we will never accept just his fire.

576
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,980
It will not work without security guarantees.

577
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,920
Security guarantees, maybe the president is right

578
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,980
about this document and other,

579
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,720
but this document is not enough.

580
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,060
Strong army is enough because his soldiers are afraid.

581
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,260
Putin's soldiers are afraid of our soldiers

582
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,500
when we're strong enough.

583
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,260
If we are not strong enough, if we are empty,

584
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:39,640
if our storage is empty, we can't defend our land.

585
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,240
Today, you know, he knows that we have,

586
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,640
all the world knows that we have meeting, yes?

587
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,720
Why he's using ballistic?

588
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,420
Putin today using ballistic on our hospitals,

589
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,920
schools, and et cetera, ballistic.

590
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,480
So he knows that we are here,

591
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,360
and that President Trump is really,

592
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,160
have good will to stop, to stop this war.

593
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,720
And you hear now, the president,

594
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,600
so why he's using, so he doesn't want to stop.

595
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,860
He doesn't want, but I hope that we will do it,

596
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,160
really, we'll do it.

597
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,860
Security, when we speak about security guarantees,

598
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:14,160
when the Europeans are ready for contingents,

599
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,000
they need USA backstop.

600
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,840
If there will not be United States,

601
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,940
we will never have any contingents,

602
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,980
strong contingents from the Europeans,

603
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,280
because they don't want to divide alliance,

604
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,340
connection between the United States,

605
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,760
the main and strongest alliance, and Europeans.

606
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,820
This is crucial, this is important.

607
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,760
That's what we want to speak about very much.

608
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,960
This is very important.

609
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,960
And air defense, so air defense,

610
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,540
really we have big deficits with all the systems,

611
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,500
and we need to provide this, we need it very much.

612
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,240
Otherwise, Putin will never stop,

613
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,700
and we'll go further and further.

614
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,580
He doesn't want, he'll hate us, you know?

615
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,720
It's not about me, he hates Ukrainians.

616
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,360
He thinks that we are not a nation.

617
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,220
He thinks, and he shares this source,

618
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,380
I think maybe with your team also, I don't know.

619
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,820
But with all the Europeans in media, officially and not,

620
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:13,860
he always said that there is no such country, such nation,

621
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,100
such language, and such life like Ukrainian.

622
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,320
No, he really doesn't respect all the Ukrainians,

623
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,940
and he wants to destroy us.

624
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,140
And you are right, Mr. President, that's 2%.

625
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,780
This document, maybe other documents.

626
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,720
It's a very good start, very good,

627
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,920
but it will not enough to stop this person.

628
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,980
Should Russia pay to...

629
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,860
Mr. President, may I have one more question, please?

630
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,680
Yeah, go ahead.

631
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,680
I asked the President...

632
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,020
They have to pay this question.

633
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,720
This is the rule, this is the rule of the war.

634
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,320
This is the rule of the war.

635
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,460
During all the centuries, all the history,

636
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,900
this is the rule of the war.

637
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,600
Who began those pay?

638
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,400
This is the rule.

639
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,780
Putin began this war.

640
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,380
He has to pay all money for innovation.

641
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,480
He has to pay.

642
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,240
Of course, some Russian assets,

643
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,820
what we have in Europe, about 300 billions,

644
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,480
we can use them.

645
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,680
We can use it for innovation

646
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,760
and buy military support from the United States also.

647
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,620
We can do it, but it's not enough.

648
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,620
It's not enough.

649
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:23,260
I asked this question that you didn't like because I wanted to know...

650
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,120
Go ahead, please, wait one second.

651
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,520
I asked this question that you didn't like

652
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,200
because I wanted to know if you want to position yourself

653
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,300
in the middle between Russia and Ukraine or on the Ukraine side.

654
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,540
No, I'm in the middle.

655
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,780
I want to solve this thing.

656
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,300
I'm for both.

657
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,080
I want to get it solved.

658
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:46,380
And it's wonderful to speak badly about somebody else,

659
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,620
but I want to get it solved.

660
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,980
If we can solve it, great.

661
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,260
If we can't solve it, they're going to have to fight it out

662
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,580
and who knows what's going to happen.

663
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,420
But I want to see it get solved.

664
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,600
May I follow up?

665
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,720
One more question about U.S. troops in Europe.

666
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,300
After the Russian invasion of Ukraine,

667
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,440
your predecessor sent additional troops to Eastern Europe,

668
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,140
including Poland, my country.

669
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:09,740
Yeah.

670
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,540
Are you committed to keeping these troops

671
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:18,840
on the eastern flank of NATO in the future?

672
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,020
I'm very committed to Poland.

673
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,080
I think Poland has really stepped up

674
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,460
and done a great job for NATO.

675
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,320
They, as you know, they paid more than they had to.

676
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,820
They are one of the finest groups of people I've ever known.

677
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,500
I'm very committed to Poland.

678
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,120
What about the Baltic?

679
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,820
Poland's in a tough neighborhood, you know.

680
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,300
What about the Baltics?

681
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:44,000
The Baltics, they got a lot of, it's a tough neighborhood, too.

682
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,040
But we're committed.

683
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,380
We're going to be very committed.

684
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,340
And we're committed to NATO.

685
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,640
But NATO has to step up.

686
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,380
And the Europeans have to step up more than they have.

687
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,820
And I want to see them equalized,

688
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,960
because they are in for far less than we're in.

689
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,120
And they should be at least equal.

690
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,380
You understand that.

691
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:03,360
Why is the United States, we have an ocean in between.

692
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,720
Why is the United States in for so much more money,

693
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,660
and other things, as Europe?

694
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,620
With that being said, and as you said,

695
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,160
they've also been obviously very helpful.

696
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,060
But we have put in far more than they have.

697
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,460
And I think they should equalize.

698
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,300
The Pressure on the agenda.

699
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,300
The Pressure on the agenda.

700
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,880
What changed between the first time

701
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,780
that Secretary Besant gave President Zelensky

702
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,600
the agreement and today for the signing?

703
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,580
The President Obama's agenda.

704
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,620
The Pressure on the agenda.

705
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,740
The President Obama's agenda.

706
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,720
The President Obama's agenda.

707
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,760
I didn't think we were going to make a deal.

708
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,600
And we ended up making the deal,

709
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,100
so that changed.

710
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,500
The Pressure on the agenda.

711
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,400
What and how do you envision a trilateral summit

712
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,440
with President Zelensky ?

713
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,440
The President Obama's agenda?

714
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,040
The President Obama's agenda.

715
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,640
President Obama's agenda.

716
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,300
I don't know, but it's-

717
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,400
The President Obama's agenda,

718
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,100
but they don't like each other, I can tell you that.

719
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,800
Okay?

720
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,680
The President Obama's agenda

721
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,700
versus the Latest Scheune.

722
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:54,780
The President Obama's agenda.

723
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,780
The President Obama's agenda.

724
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,540
They don't like, okay?

725
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,900
The Almost economy.

726
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,500
The President Obama's agenda.

727
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,380
The President Obama's agenda.

728
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,440
The President Obama's agenda shortly thereafter.

729
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,480
United States, run by a man that didn't know much.

730
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,320
I'm going to be very nice.

731
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,120
Run by an incompetent person.

732
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,820
Very incompetent person.

733
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,320
Should never have allowed this to happen.

734
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,160
I've stopped wars.

735
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,860
I've stopped many wars.

736
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,800
My people will tell you, I stopped wars that nobody

737
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,620
ever heard about.

738
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,320
I stopped wars before they ever started.

739
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,560
You can look at some of the, some of, I could give

740
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,440
you a lot of nations that would tell you right now

741
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,760
they were probably going to war.

742
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,600
I could tell you right now there's a nation thinking

743
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,740
about going to war on something that nobody in this

744
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,440
room has ever even heard about.

745
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,100
Two smaller nations, but big.

746
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,680
Still big.

747
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,180
And I think I've stopped it.

748
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,180
But this should have never happened.

749
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,040
The Pressure President, do you want to talk about

750
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:54,040
about any negotiations?

751
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,120
First of all, I want really to tell you, and I think

752
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,860
that everybody understands that Ukraine, more than

753
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,600
Ukrainians, nobody wants to stop this war.

754
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,640
But in the future, any negotiations, it's

755
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:12,700
understandable that two sides of the war, not Russia and

756
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,140
the United States, because this is not the war between

757
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,580
Russia and the United States.

758
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,420
This is a war of Russia against Ukraine and

759
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,240
Ukrainian people.

760
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,740
So these two sides will be at any, anyway, will be at the

761
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,220
negotiation, a negotiation table.

762
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,720
Then, of course, United States, like the strongest partner of

763
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,080
the Ukraine.

764
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,760
And, of course, Europe.

765
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,420
I think Europe is very important.

766
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,020
I want to speak about it with the President.

767
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,500
Yes, Europe is very important for us because we really defend

768
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,500
Europe for today.

769
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:48,240
All the Europeans really recognize that we are defending

770
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,800
the line, and they have real life, and our people are dying.

771
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,040
That's why they helped us.

772
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,320
And also, it's about the nature.

773
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,420
Yes, between, like the President said, you have big, nice

774
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,620
ocean.

775
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,580
Yes, between us.

776
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,400
But if we will not stay, Russia will go further to

777
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,560
Baltics and to Poland, by the way.

778
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,860
But first to the Baltics.

779
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:15,360
It's understandable for them because they've been in the

780
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,140
USSR, you know, they've been one of the republics of the

781
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,200
USSR, and Putin wants to bring them back to his empire.

782
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,100
It's a fact.

783
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,100
And when he will go there, if we will not stay, you will

784
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,040
fight.

785
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,480
Your American soldiers, it doesn't matter.

786
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,580
Do you have ocean or not?

787
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,420
Your soldiers will fight.

788
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,420
Mr. President, would you be willing to visit Ukraine?

789
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,180
The cave or Odessa, which is known to be a 30-year

790
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,180
liberal class?

791
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,180
The President, it was my question.

792
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:46,180
The President, I don't want to talk about Odessa now.

793
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,680
Let's not talk about Odessa.

794
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,860
I want to talk about making a deal, getting peace.

795
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,000
We don't have to talk about Odessa.

796
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,120
But a lot of cities have been destroyed.

797
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,040
There are a lot of cities that are not recognizable.

798
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,740
There's not a building standing.

799
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,740
And a lot of things have happened.

800
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,900
Mr. President, you have to come and to look.

801
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,740
No, no, no.

802
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,500
We have very good cities.

803
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,420
Yes, a lot of things have been destroyed.

804
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,520
But mostly cities alive.

805
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,880
And people work.

806
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,220
And children go to school.

807
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,480
Sometimes it's very difficult.

808
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,860
Sometimes closer to front line.

809
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:21,320
Children have to go to underground schools or online.

810
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,020
But we live.

811
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,160
Ukraine is fighting.

812
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,660
And Ukraine lives.

813
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,260
This is very important.

814
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,600
And maybe it's Putin is sharing this information

815
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,000
that he destroyed us.

816
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,840
He lost 700,000 people.

817
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,100
700,000 soldiers he lost in Eversi.

818
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,300
Yes.

819
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,280
Mr. President, when did you last speak with President Putin?

820
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,440
Please, go ahead.

821
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,640
Mr. When did you last speak with President Putin?

822
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,580
And what did he say that he did?

823
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,540
A couple of days ago.

824
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,620
And what did he tell you that gave you the assurance

825
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,280
that he wanted peace?

826
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,120
Well, that's what I do.

827
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,420
My whole life is deals.

828
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:57,080
I know pretty good.

829
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,280
And I really, I've known him for a long time.

830
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,380
I've dealt with him for a long time.

831
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:05,080
He had to suffer through the Russia hoax.

832
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,260
You know, Russia, Russia, Russia.

833
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,420
It was a hoax.

834
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,300
It was all Biden.

835
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,060
It was nothing to do with him.

836
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,500
So he had to suffer through that.

837
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,060
And he was able to do that.

838
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,200
I think that he wants to make a deal.

839
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,800
And he would like to see it end.

840
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,500
That's all I do.

841
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,100
That's what I do.

842
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,300
My whole life, that's what I do is make deals.

843
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,640
And I'm in the middle of a mess.

844
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,820
Because this is a real mess.

845
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,720
It's a very dangerous one.

846
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,120
If this doesn't get solved now, it's not going to get solved for a long time.

847
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,120
So I hope we're going to get it solved.

848
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,000
In the back, please.

849
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
The Press.

850
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
The Press.

851
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
The Press.

852
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:52,980
Well, we actually spoke to him about that yesterday, and we thought they took it very, very much too far.

853
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,980
JD was very strong on it.

854
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,280
So was I.

855
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,880
So was Marco.

856
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:59,280
And we've been speaking to him about it.

857
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,280
Marco, would you like to say something about it?

858
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,580
Yeah, we have concerns, obviously, with the conduct of various, particularly as it impacts Americans.

859
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:11,280
And there's real concern that American speech, which is online, could fall into the hands of the British or any country's jurisdiction.

860
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:21,280
And so this is a point the Vice President made in Munich, and I think it's a very compelling one that unites us with Europe, as much as anything else, is these shared values, and one of them being free speech.

861
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:28,280
And so Americans are threatened by it. We're going to need to take action in that regard.

862
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,280
It's a very important question.

863
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:38,280
We spoke about this in detail with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary and others at lunch yesterday, and I know that they are going to be a very important question.

864
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,280
It's a big question.

865
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:47,280
We spoke about this in detail with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary and others at lunch yesterday.

866
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:55,280
And I know that the Secretary of Commerce, Lutnik, followed up in private meetings last night.

867
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,280
This is really important.

868
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,280
We believe Americans have the right to speak their mind, even if we in this room disagree with them.

869
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,280
They have the right to speak their mind in the public square, which is often online these days.

870
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:12,280
And we're going to defend that right as it pertains to American companies and American citizens vigorously if we have to.

871
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:18,280
I do think that under the President's leadership, we're going to find common ground with our friends in the UK on this question.

872
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,280
But it remains to be seen.

873
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:26,280
The principle that will guide us is we believe in free speech in this country and we'll fight for it for American citizens.

874
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,280
Mr. President, on the deal, is there any other oil and gas component to the deal?

875
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,280
Is it all critical?

876
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,280
A little bit. We'll see.

877
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,280
On LNG?

878
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,280
Mr. But we're not really looking for that so much. We've got a lot. We have more than anybody in the world by far.

879
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:44,280
So, no, we're not talking about it too much, but a little bit. I think it affects also. But for the most part, no.

880
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:53,280
And, sir, is there any agreement from Ukraine to purchase US LNG as part of the deal? Or is that on the table at all?

881
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,280
Mr. No. We don't need that.

882
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,280
Mr. President, I just wanted to ask you about, you just mentioned that you'd spoken to Vladimir Putin a couple of days ago.

883
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,280
Just to be clear, that's a new call, not the one that you're talking about.

884
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,280
Mr. I've spoken to him on numerous occasions.

885
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:11,280
Okay. And how was the latest call? And what did you discuss? How did it go?

886
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,280
Mr. Are you serious with that question?

887
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,280
Mr. I am. I'd love to know.

888
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,280
Mr. It went well. I think we're going to have a deal.

889
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,280
On the minerals deal, Mr. President, some of those minerals are in the east of Ukraine, not far from the front lines.

890
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,280
And in areas that Russia's .

891
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,280
Mr. A very good question. Thank you so much.

892
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,280
Does President Putin withdraw his forces from those areas if there are U.S. interests?

893
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:37,280
Mr. Well, we'll take a look at the time. We have a lot of area. It's a very big area we're talking about. So, we'll take a look. I'll study that, and I'll see.

894
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,280
And who would protect those minerals if they are U.S. interests? Would that be a U.S. interest?

895
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,280
Mr. They'll be protected. The agreement will protect them.

896
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,280
The agreement, yeah. We're signing an agreement.

897
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,280
Mr. So, there is a big deal, but what if Russia tries to invade or orders Russian and Russia into a spy?

898
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
Mr. I just told you, I don't think that's going to happen.

899
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,240
And if that were going to happen, I wouldn't make a deal.

900
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,720
If I thought that was going to happen, I wouldn't make a deal.

901
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,260
You know, they ought to focus on CNN, on survival,

902
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:05,660
not asking me these ridiculous questions.

903
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,800
Focus on surviving, because CNN has got such low ratings,

904
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,440
I don't think they're going to survive.

905
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,660
Let's go.

906
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,860
Yeah, please, go ahead.

907
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,860
One more.

908
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,400
Since I already mentioned Poland,

909
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,940
Poland was under Russian control for decades

910
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,840
after the Second World War.

911
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,600
When I was a kid, I looked at the United States,

912
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:31,040
not only as a most powerful country, richest country in the world,

913
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,680
the country that has great music, great movies, great muscle cars,

914
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,400
but also as a force for good.

915
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,920
Do you, and now I'm talking with my friends in Poland,

916
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,860
and they are worried that you align yourself too much with Putin.

917
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:50,360
What's your message for them?

918
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,660
Well, if I didn't align myself with both of them,

919
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,560
you'd never have a deal.

920
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:59,360
You want me to say really terrible things about Putin,

921
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,180
and then say, hi, Vladimir, how are we doing on the deal?

922
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,800
That doesn't work that way.

923
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,240
I'm not aligned with Putin.

924
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,540
I'm not aligned with anybody.

925
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,840
I'm aligned with the United States of America,

926
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,280
and for the good of the world.

927
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,360
I'm aligned with the world, and I want to get this thing over with.

928
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,200
You see the hatred he's got for Putin.

929
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,740
It's very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate.

930
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,440
He's got tremendous hatred, and I understand that,

931
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,640
but I can tell you the other side isn't exactly in love with,

932
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,040
you know, him either.

933
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,180
So it's not a question of alignment.

934
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,940
I have to, I'm aligned with the world.

935
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,040
I want to get the thing set.

936
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,540
I'm aligned with Europe.

937
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,480
I want to see if we can get this thing done.

938
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,580
You want me to be tough?

939
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:43,120
I could be tougher than any human being you've ever seen.

940
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,120
I'd be so tough.

941
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,720
But you're never going to get a deal that way.

942
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,280
So that's the way it goes.

943
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,360
All right, one more question.

944
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,720
Yeah, please.

945
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,720
The President, I want to respond to this.

946
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,620
So, look, for four years in the United States of America,

947
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,060
we had a President who stood up at press conferences

948
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,400
and talked tough about Vladimir Putin,

949
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,400
and then Putin invaded Ukraine

950
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,080
and destroyed a significant chunk of the country.

951
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,440
The path to peace and the path to prosperity

952
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,280
is maybe engaging in diplomacy.

953
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,980
We tried the pathway of Joe Biden,

954
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,360
of thumping our chest and pretending

955
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,920
that the President of the United States' words

956
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,120
mattered more than the President of the United States' actions.

957
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,020
What makes America a good country

958
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,260
is America engaging in diplomacy.

959
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,860
That's what President Trump is doing.

960
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,660
Can I ask you?

961
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,200
Sure.

962
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:29,740
Yeah?

963
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,300
Yeah.

964
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,100
Okay.

965
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:36,800
So he occupied it, our parts, big parts of Ukraine,

966
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,140
parts of East and Crimea.

967
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,580
So he occupied it on 2014.

968
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:48,660
So during a lot of years, I'm not speaking about just Biden,

969
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,820
but those time was Obama, then President Obama,

970
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,020
then President Trump, then President Biden,

971
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,620
and now President Trump, and God bless,

972
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,660
now President Trump will stop him.

973
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,360
But during 2014, nobody stopped him.

974
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,260
He just occupied and took.

975
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,200
He killed people.

976
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,400
You know what the contact line?

977
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,200
2015.

978
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:08,900
2014.

979
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,640
2014.

980
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,300
2014.

981
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:10,900
Yeah, yeah.

982
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,640
So he killed-

983
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,500
I was not here.

984
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:12,900
Yeah, but-

985
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,840
That's exactly right.

986
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:20,640
Yes, but during 2014 till 2022, was the situation the same?

987
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,120
That people have been dying on the contact line.

988
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,620
Nobody stopped him.

989
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,520
You know that we had conversations with him,

990
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,360
a lot of conversations, my bilateral conversation,

991
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,300
and we signed with him, me, like a new president.

992
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:39,140
In 2019, I signed with him the deal.

993
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,940
I signed with him, Macron, and Merkel.

994
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,840
We signed a ceasefire, ceasefire.

995
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,520
All of them told me that he will never go.

996
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:52,680
We signed him a gas contract, gas contract.

997
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,120
Yes, but after that, he broke the ceasefire.

998
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,920
He killed our people, and he didn't exchange prisoners.

999
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,260
We signed the exchange of prisoners, but he didn't do it.

1000
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,500
What kind of diplomacy, J.D., you are speaking about?

1001
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,640
What do you mean?

1002
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,400
I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy

1003
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,160
that's going to end the destruction of your country.

1004
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,300
Yes, but if you are not strong-

1005
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,880
Mr. President, Mr. President, with respect,

1006
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,300
I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office

1007
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,580
and try to litigate this in front of the American media.

1008
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,040
Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts

1009
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,920
to the front lines because you have manpower problems.

1010
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,060
You should be thanking the President for trying to bring it into this conflict.

1011
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,360
Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have?

1012
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,660
I have been to-

1013
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,320
Come once.

1014
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:41,620
I have actually watched and seen the stories, and I know that what happens is you bring people,

1015
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:44,620
you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President.

1016
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:48,140
Do you disagree that you've had problems bringing people into your military?

1017
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,140
We have problems.

1018
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:53,380
Do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America

1019
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:57,680
and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?

1020
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,140
A lot of questions.

1021
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,320
Let's start from the beginning.

1022
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,320
Sure.

1023
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,480
First of all, during the war, everybody has problems.

1024
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,480
Even you.

1025
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,360
But you have nice ocean, and don't feel now.

1026
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,560
But you will feel it in the future.

1027
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,560
God bless.

1028
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,560
You don't know that.

1029
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,560
God bless.

1030
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,900
You will not have a war.

1031
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,640
Don't tell us what we're going to feel.

1032
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,200
We're trying to solve a problem.

1033
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,800
Don't tell us what we're going to feel.

1034
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,800
I'm not telling you.

1035
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,800
I'm not saying on this question.

1036
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,800
Because you're in no position to dictate that.

1037
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,800
Remember this.

1038
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,980
You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel.

1039
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,480
We're going to feel very good.

1040
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,680
You will feel influenced.

1041
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,980
We're going to feel very good and very strong.

1042
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:33,980
I'm telling you.

1043
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:34,980
You will feel influenced.

1044
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,720
You're right now not in a very good position.

1045
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,660
You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position, and he happens to be right about it.

1046
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:43,720
From the very beginning of the war, Mr. President, you're not in a good position.

1047
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,480
You don't have the cards right now.

1048
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,480
With us, you start having cards.

1049
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,480
I'm not playing cards.

1050
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,480
But right now, you don't.

1051
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,480
You're playing cards.

1052
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,480
I'm very serious, Mr. President.

1053
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,480
You're playing cards.

1054
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,480
I'm very serious.

1055
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,480
I'm the president in war.

1056
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,480
You're gambling with the lives of millions of people.

1057
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,480
You're gambling with World War III.

1058
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,480
What else?

1059
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,480
What are you thinking about?

1060
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,540
You're gambling with World War III.

1061
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:04,540
And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country.

1062
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,540
This country.

1063
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,540
It's back to you.

1064
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,540
I'm with all respect to your country.

1065
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,540
Far more than a lot of people said they should have.

1066
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,540
Have you said thank you once this entire meeting?

1067
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,540
A lot of times.

1068
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:17,160
So, in this entire meeting that you said thank you, you went to Pennsylvania and campaigned

1069
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,500
for the opposition in October.

1070
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:23,840
Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's

1071
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,300
trying to save your country.

1072
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,440
Please.

1073
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,300
You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war, you can speak.

1074
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,300
He's not speaking loudly.

1075
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,920
He's not speaking loudly.

1076
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,040
Your country is in big trouble.

1077
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,040
Can I answer?

1078
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,040
Wait a minute.

1079
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,040
There's a lot of talking.

1080
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,660
Your country is in big trouble.

1081
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:41,660
I know.

1082
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:42,660
I know.

1083
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,660
You're not winning.

1084
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,660
You're not winning this.

1085
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:47,660
You have a damn good chance of coming out okay because of us.

1086
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,340
Mr. President, we are staying in our country.

1087
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:52,000
Staying strong from the very beginning of the war.

1088
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,220
We've been alone.

1089
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,220
And we are thankful.

1090
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,220
I said thanks.

1091
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,220
You haven't been alone.

1092
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,220
Not only in this cabinet.

1093
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:01,220
We gave you, through the stupid president, $350 billion.

1094
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,220
You voted for your president.

1095
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,220
We gave you military equipment.

1096
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,220
You voted for your president.

1097
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,220
And you men are brave.

1098
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,220
But they had to use our military.

1099
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,220
Yes.

1100
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:08,220
What about West?

1101
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,220
If you didn't have our military equipment.

1102
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,220
You invited me.

1103
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,220
You invited me to speak.

1104
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:15,220
If you didn't have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.

1105
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,220
In three days.

1106
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,220
I heard it from Putin.

1107
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,220
In three days.

1108
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,220
This is something new.

1109
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,220
Maybe less.

1110
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,220
In two weeks.

1111
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,220
Of course, yes.

1112
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,220
It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this.

1113
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,220
I tell you, just say thank you.

1114
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:29,220
I said a lot of times thank you to American people.

1115
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,220
Except that there are disagreements.

1116
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:36,220
And let's go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it out in the American

1117
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,220
media when you're wrong.

1118
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:38,220
We know that you're wrong.

1119
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:42,220
But you see, I think it's good for the American people to see what's going on over here.

1120
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:43,220
I think it's very important.

1121
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:45,220
That's why I kept this going so long.

1122
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,220
You have to be thankful.

1123
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,220
You don't have the cards.

1124
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:49,220
I'm thankful.

1125
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,220
You're buried there.

1126
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,220
Your people are dying.

1127
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,220
I can tell you.

1128
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,220
You're running low on soldiers.

1129
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,220
I know.

1130
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,220
Don't, please.

1131
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,220
You're running low on soldiers.

1132
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,220
It would be a damn good thing.

1133
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,220
Mr. President.

1134
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,220
Then you tell us, I don't want a ceasefire.

1135
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,220
I don't want a ceasefire.

1136
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:03,220
I want to go.

1137
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,220
And I wanted this.

1138
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:09,220
Look, if you could get a ceasefire right now, I'd tell you, you'd take it.

1139
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:12,220
So the bullets stop flying and your men stop getting killed.

1140
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,220
Of course, we want to stop the war.

1141
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,220
But I said to you.

1142
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,220
But I said to you.

1143
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,220
With guarantees.

1144
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,220
With guarantees.

1145
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,220
Because you'll get a ceasefire faster than an agreement.

1146
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,220
Ask our people about ceasefire.

1147
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,220
What do they think?

1148
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,220
It doesn't matter for you what it means.

1149
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,220
It wasn't with me.

1150
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,220
It wasn't with you.

1151
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:29,220
That was with a guy named Biden, who was not a smart person.

1152
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,220
That was with Obama.

1153
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,220
This is your president.

1154
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,220
It was your president.

1155
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,220
Excuse me.

1156
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:35,220
That was with Obama, who gave you sheets.

1157
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,220
And I gave you javelins.

1158
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:37,220
Yes.

1159
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:40,220
I gave you the javelins to take out all those tanks.

1160
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,220
Obama gave you sheets.

1161
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:47,220
In fact, the statement is, Obama gave sheets and Trump gave javelins.

1162
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:50,220
You got to be more thankful.

1163
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,220
Because let me tell you, you don't have the cards.

1164
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:54,220
With us, you have the cards.

1165
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:56,220
But without us, you don't have any cards.

1166
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:59,220
One more question to Mr. Vice President.

1167
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,220
I'm sorry.

1168
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,220
It's going to be a tough deal to make.

1169
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,220
Because the attitudes have to change.

1170
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:07,220
What if Russia breaks this fire?

1171
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:09,220
What if Russia breaks these talks?

1172
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:10,220
What do you do then?

1173
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:14,220
I understand that it's a heated conversation right now.

1174
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,220
What are you saying?

1175
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:18,220
She's asking what if Russia breaks the ceasefire?

1176
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:20,220
What if they, what if anything?

1177
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,220
What if a bomb drops on your head right now?

1178
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,220
Okay?

1179
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:25,220
What if they broke it?

1180
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,220
I don't know.

1181
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,220
They broke it with Biden.

1182
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,220
Because Biden, they didn't respect him.

1183
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,220
They didn't respect Obama.

1184
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,220
They respect me.

1185
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:35,220
Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me.

1186
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,220
He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia,

1187
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,220
Russia, Russia, Russia.

1188
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,220
You ever hear of that deal?

1189
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:46,220
That was a phony, that was a phony Hunter Biden, Joe Biden scam.

1190
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:49,220
Hillary Clinton, Shifty Adam Schiff.

1191
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,220
It was a Democrat scam.

1192
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,220
And he had to go through that.

1193
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,220
And he did go through it.

1194
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,220
We didn't end up in a war.

1195
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,220
And he went through it.

1196
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,220
He was accused of all that stuff.

1197
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:59,220
He had nothing to do with it.

1198
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,220
It came out of Hunter Biden's bathroom.

1199
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:06,220
It came out of Hunter Biden's bedroom.

1200
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,220
It was disgusting.

1201
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:14,220
And then they said, oh, oh, the laptop from hell was made by Russia.

1202
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,220
The 51 agents.

1203
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,220
The whole thing was a scam.

1204
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,220
And he had to put up with that.

1205
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:21,220
He was being accused of all that stuff.

1206
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:23,220
All I can say is this.

1207
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:27,220
He might have broken deals with Obama and Bush.

1208
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,220
And he might have broken them with Biden.

1209
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,220
He did, maybe.

1210
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,220
Maybe he didn't.

1211
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:32,220
I don't know what happened.

1212
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,220
But he didn't break them with me.

1213
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,220
He wants to make a deal.

1214
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,220
I don't know if you can make a deal.

1215
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:40,220
The problem is, I've empowered you to be a tough guy.

1216
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:44,220
And I don't think you'd be a tough guy without the United States.

1217
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,220
And your people are very brave.

1218
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:49,220
But you're either going to make a deal or we're out.

1219
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:52,220
And if we're out, you'll fight it out.

1220
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,220
I don't think it's going to be pretty.

1221
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:55,220
But you'll fight it out.

1222
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:57,220
But you don't have the cards.

1223
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:01,220
But once we sign that deal, you're in a much better position.

1224
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,220
But you're not acting at all thankful.

1225
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,220
And that's not a nice thing.

1226
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:05,220
I'll be honest.

1227
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:06,220
That's not a nice thing.

1228
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,220
All right.

1229
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,220
I think we've seen enough.

1230
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:10,220
What do you think?

1231
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:13,220
This is going to be great television.

1232
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:14,220
I will say that.

1233
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:16,220
All right.

1234
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:19,220
We'll see what we can do about putting it together.

1235
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,220
Thank you.

1236
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,220
Thanks.
