00:00.660 --> 00:01.600
The President, thank you very much.

00:01.600 --> 00:05.740
It's an honor to have President Zelensky of Ukraine.

00:05.740 --> 00:08.340
And we've been working very hard, very close.

00:08.340 --> 00:10.380
So we've actually known each other for a long time.

00:10.380 --> 00:12.720
We've been dealing with each other for a long time

00:12.720 --> 00:14.640
and very well.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.060
We had a little negotiation spat,

00:17.060 --> 00:20.080
but that worked out great, I think, for both countries.

00:20.080 --> 00:23.600
I think for the world, actually, beyond both countries.

00:23.600 --> 00:28.060
And we have something that is a very fair deal.

00:28.060 --> 00:30.960
And we look forward to getting in and digging,

00:30.960 --> 00:32.440
digging, digging, and working

00:32.440 --> 00:35.300
and getting some of the rare earth.

00:35.300 --> 00:36.860
But it means we're going to be inside.

00:36.860 --> 00:40.240
And it's a big commitment from the United States.

00:40.240 --> 00:43.740
And we appreciate working with you very much.

00:43.740 --> 00:45.840
And we will continue to do that.

00:45.840 --> 00:49.340
We have had some very good discussions with Russia.

00:49.340 --> 00:51.780
I spoke with President Putin.

00:51.780 --> 00:54.060
And we're going to try and bring this to a close.

00:54.060 --> 00:55.880
It's something that you want and that he wants.

00:55.880 --> 00:58.060
We have to negotiate a deal.

00:58.060 --> 01:00.300
But we've started the confines of a deal.

01:00.300 --> 01:03.860
And I think something can happen.

01:03.860 --> 01:07.960
The big thing is the number of soldiers,

01:07.960 --> 01:10.280
mostly at this point, but soldiers being killed.

01:10.280 --> 01:12.000
You're losing thousands of soldiers.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
On both sides, we're losing a lot of soldiers.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.480
And we want to see it stop.

01:16.480 --> 01:19.780
And we want to see the money get put to different kinds of use,

01:19.780 --> 01:22.280
like rebuilding, the rebuilding.

01:22.280 --> 01:24.880
And we're going to be working very hard.

01:24.880 --> 01:27.160
But we've had a lot of very good conversations.

01:27.160 --> 01:30.840
I will say until we came along, the Biden administration

01:30.840 --> 01:32.840
didn't speak to Russia whatsoever.

01:32.840 --> 01:33.840
They didn't speak to anybody.

01:33.840 --> 01:36.740
They just allowed this to continue.

01:36.740 --> 01:40.640
And I will say that I'll say in front of you,

01:40.640 --> 01:42.740
you've heard me say it a thousand times.

01:42.740 --> 01:45.080
If I were President, this war would have never happened.

01:45.080 --> 01:46.920
We would have had a deal negotiated for you

01:46.920 --> 01:50.860
without having to go through what you've gone through.

01:50.860 --> 01:54.220
But you, your soldiers have been unbelievably brave.

01:54.220 --> 01:55.560
We've given them great equipment,

01:55.560 --> 01:57.360
but they've, somebody has to use the equipment.

01:57.360 --> 02:00.240
They've been unbelievably brave.

02:00.240 --> 02:01.860
And we give them great credit.

02:01.860 --> 02:04.480
This was supposed to be over very quickly.

02:04.480 --> 02:07.700
And here we are three years later.

02:07.700 --> 02:10.740
So I give tremendous credit to your generals

02:10.740 --> 02:13.580
and your soldiers and yourself in the sense

02:13.580 --> 02:18.420
that it's been very hard fighting, very tough fighting.

02:18.420 --> 02:20.280
They're great fighters.

02:20.280 --> 02:23.460
And you have to be very proud of them from that standpoint.

02:23.460 --> 02:25.460
But now we want to get it over with.

02:25.460 --> 02:27.820
It's enough, right, if we want to get it over with.

02:27.820 --> 02:30.560
So it's an honor to have you here.

02:30.560 --> 02:31.760
Thank you very much for coming.

02:31.760 --> 02:36.260
We're going to sign the agreement at the conference

02:36.260 --> 02:40.640
in the East Room in a little while, right after lunch.

02:40.640 --> 02:42.060
And we'll be having lunch together.

02:42.060 --> 02:45.040
We're also discussing some other things.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.040
And we appreciate everybody being here.

02:47.040 --> 02:49.580
It's a, somewhat of an exciting moment.

02:49.580 --> 02:52.500
But the really exciting moment is when we get a,

02:52.500 --> 02:54.920
when they stop the shooting and we end up with a deal.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.780
And I think we're fairly close to getting that.

02:56.780 --> 02:58.980
And an honor to have you.

02:58.980 --> 03:01.480
And please, would you like to say something?

03:01.480 --> 03:02.620
The President Trump Jr.: No, thank you so much,

03:02.620 --> 03:03.620
Mr. President.

03:03.620 --> 03:05.760
Thank you for your invitation.

03:05.760 --> 03:10.960
And really, I hope that this document, first document,

03:10.960 --> 03:14.100
will be a first step to real security guarantees for Ukraine,

03:14.100 --> 03:16.100
our people, our children.

03:16.100 --> 03:17.800
I really count on it.

03:17.800 --> 03:21.580
And of course, we count that America will not stop support.

03:21.580 --> 03:24.720
Really, for us, it's very important to support

03:24.720 --> 03:26.320
and to continue it.

03:26.320 --> 03:30.520
I want to discuss it with details further during our conversation

03:30.520 --> 03:33.920
and, of course, the infrastructure or security guarantees.

03:33.920 --> 03:37.720
Because for today, I understand what Europe is ready to do.

03:37.720 --> 03:40.520
And of course, I want to discuss with you what United States

03:40.520 --> 03:42.260
will be ready to do.

03:42.260 --> 03:46.340
And I really count on your strong position to stop Putin.

03:46.340 --> 03:49.540
And you said that enough with the war.

03:49.540 --> 03:53.680
I think that is very important, Ben, to say these words to Putin

03:53.680 --> 03:54.680
at the very beginning.

03:54.680 --> 03:58.020
At the very beginning of war, because he's a killer and terrorist.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.980
But I hope that together we can stop him.

04:00.980 --> 04:06.780
But for us, it's very important to save our country, our values,

04:06.780 --> 04:09.480
our freedom and democracy.

04:09.480 --> 04:14.260
And of course, no compromises with the killer about our territories.

04:14.260 --> 04:16.000
But it will be later.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.660
And of course, what I wanted, you know we spoke about it by phone

04:19.660 --> 04:21.900
with you about the drones production.

04:21.900 --> 04:23.560
We have very good drones production.

04:23.560 --> 04:27.340
I think the best one in the world for today because of the war.

04:27.340 --> 04:32.320
Yes, and of course, we need very much the air defense.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.480
You have the best air defense in the world.

04:34.480 --> 04:37.780
And really, you helped us under attacks of Russians.

04:37.780 --> 04:41.160
And I want to speak how we can exchange the licenses.

04:41.160 --> 04:45.120
We're open to share the licenses of all our drones with you,

04:45.120 --> 04:46.460
of course, with the United States.

04:46.460 --> 04:49.900
And we need licenses for quick production of air defense.

04:49.900 --> 04:54.060
Even after the war, we need our nation to be calm,

04:54.060 --> 04:55.100
that we are secure.

04:55.100 --> 04:57.740
So that's why we need this air shield.

04:57.740 --> 05:02.640
And of course, about this, I want to speak about the contingents.

05:02.640 --> 05:06.580
I think that France and UK already spoke to you.

05:06.580 --> 05:09.840
And we know that Europe is ready, but without the United States,

05:09.840 --> 05:14.580
they will not be ready to be as strong as we need.

05:14.580 --> 05:18.960
And the last point, last not least, about exchange,

05:18.960 --> 05:21.200
about our people and children.

05:21.200 --> 05:26.180
And you know that this crazy Russian that they've stolen 20,000 of children,

05:26.180 --> 05:29.000
Ukrainian children, they changed their names.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.480
They changed their, you know, their families, relatives.

05:32.480 --> 05:34.520
And now they're in Russia.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.520
We want to bring them back.

05:36.520 --> 05:40.360
And really, it's a big, big dream, task and goal for me.

05:40.360 --> 05:45.400
And our warriors, we, by the way, Mr. President, we brought,

05:45.400 --> 05:50.240
we exchanged, we, yes, released more than 4,000 warriors

05:50.240 --> 05:55.000
from Russian prison, but there are thousands more in the prison.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.280
I wanted to share with you some, some images, how, how,

06:00.280 --> 06:02.840
just, just, can I, can I now?

06:02.840 --> 06:04.120
Yeah, please, please.

06:04.120 --> 06:10.320
One minute, one minute, just you to understand what, in what circumstances,

06:10.320 --> 06:14.840
in what situation they are, and what the attitude of Russia to our prisons.

06:14.840 --> 06:19.700
That, guys, just you, before, before and after.

06:19.700 --> 06:23.000
And you see, before and after, just you to understand.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.440
Now, thousands of such guys, ladies and men, there.

06:27.440 --> 06:32.120
And that, so they don't eat, they beat them, and they, you know,

06:32.120 --> 06:36.520
they do a lot of, a lot of, you know, bad things.

06:36.520 --> 06:39.960
So, out of, even during the war, there are rules.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.520
Everybody knows, there are rules during the war.

06:42.520 --> 06:46.000
These guys, they don't have any rules, you see that.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
50, 60 kilograms left, and a lot of such things.

06:51.000 --> 06:56.240
And I didn't want to show you what, what the changes with images of children,

06:56.240 --> 06:59.040
because I will share, just share with you.

06:59.040 --> 07:02.320
And, I mean, it's looking tragic.

07:02.320 --> 07:03.720
Yep, that's tough stuff.

07:03.720 --> 07:08.160
Yeah, yeah, I wanted very much to, to give you, and you, you see.

07:08.160 --> 07:08.760
Yeah.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.460
This is pastor, by the way.

07:10.460 --> 07:13.260
They stolen pastors, because it's not Russian church.

07:13.260 --> 07:16.600
They stolen pastors and moved pastors to the prison.

07:16.600 --> 07:21.360
We, at the end of last year, we, we brought three pastors,

07:21.360 --> 07:24.660
and we, we could exchange them.

07:24.660 --> 07:27.260
This is pastor, you see.

07:27.260 --> 07:28.740
Yeah, that's tough.

07:28.740 --> 07:32.560
Yeah, so, I mean, this, I wanted to show you, and this.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.900
So, thank you very much.

07:33.900 --> 07:35.180
We want to get that ended, right?

07:35.180 --> 07:37.140
Yeah, yeah, of course, we, of course, we want to.

07:37.140 --> 07:37.980
And I think we will.

07:37.980 --> 07:39.580
I think we will.

07:39.580 --> 07:40.380
And, uh...

07:40.380 --> 07:41.720
We have to, of course.

07:41.720 --> 07:42.940
Do you have any questions, please?

07:42.940 --> 07:46.080
When you continue, to ask you about, Mr. President,

07:46.080 --> 07:46.880
just a quick question.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.080
Thank you, Mr. President.

07:48.080 --> 07:49.620
We think that, how much money is the U.S.

07:49.620 --> 07:52.020
going to put into the fund that is being created today?

07:52.020 --> 07:55.620
And how does this provide long-term security for Ukraine?

07:55.620 --> 07:57.360
Well, we don't know exactly how much,

07:57.360 --> 08:00.460
because we're going to be putting some money in a fund

08:00.460 --> 08:02.660
that we're going to get from the raw earth

08:02.660 --> 08:06.400
that we're going to be taking and sharing in terms of revenue.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.540
So, it's going to be a lot of money will be made

08:08.540 --> 08:11.140
from the sale and from the use of raw earth.

08:11.140 --> 08:13.980
And, as you know, our country doesn't have much raw earth.

08:13.980 --> 08:16.680
We have a lot of oil and gas,

08:16.680 --> 08:19.520
but we don't have a lot of the raw earth.

08:19.520 --> 08:23.020
And what we do have is protected by the environmentalists,

08:23.020 --> 08:24.360
but that could be unprotected.

08:24.360 --> 08:26.960
But still, it's not very much.

08:26.960 --> 08:31.060
They have among the best in the world, in terms of raw earth.

08:31.060 --> 08:34.700
So, we're going to be using that, taking it,

08:34.700 --> 08:36.540
using it for all of the things we do,

08:36.540 --> 08:40.280
including AI and including weapons and the military.

08:40.280 --> 08:43.720
And it's really going to very much satisfy our needs.

08:43.720 --> 08:46.820
So, something that just worked out really well.

08:46.820 --> 08:48.780
We have a lot of oil and we have a lot of gas.

08:48.780 --> 08:50.680
We have a lot, but we don't have raw earth.

08:50.680 --> 08:55.680
So, this has just about every component of the raw earth

08:55.680 --> 08:59.360
that we need for computers, for all of the things we do.

08:59.360 --> 09:00.620
This puts us in great shape.

09:00.620 --> 09:02.620
The Press Presser and the long-term security program.

09:02.620 --> 09:03.620
How is this provided?

09:03.620 --> 09:05.360
The President Biden I think they're going to have great long.

09:05.360 --> 09:06.740
I think once we make the agreement,

09:06.740 --> 09:08.500
that's going to be 95 percent of it.

09:08.500 --> 09:11.440
It's, they're not going to go back to fighting.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.640
I've spoken with President Putin.

09:13.640 --> 09:16.340
And I think, I mean, I feel very strong.

09:16.340 --> 09:18.080
I've known them for a long time.

09:18.080 --> 09:22.440
And I feel very strongly that they're very serious about it.

09:22.440 --> 09:23.580
And we'll make a deal.

09:23.580 --> 09:25.640
And when the deal is made, I don't think,

09:25.640 --> 09:26.780
we talk about security.

09:26.780 --> 09:28.180
Everyone's talking about the other day,

09:28.180 --> 09:29.460
all they talked about was security.

09:29.460 --> 09:31.580
I said, let me make the deal first.

09:31.580 --> 09:32.800
I have to make the deal first.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.260
I don't worry about security right now.

09:34.260 --> 09:36.100
I have to, we have to have a deal.

09:36.100 --> 09:40.640
Because right now, last week, 2,000 soldiers died on both sides.

09:40.640 --> 09:45.920
2,000 and they're losing 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 a week.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.380
So as we sit here and we talk,

09:47.380 --> 09:50.920
people are getting shot and dying on the battlefield.

09:50.920 --> 09:53.360
And you know, they're not American soldiers,

09:53.360 --> 09:56.620
but they're Russian soldiers and they're Ukrainian soldiers.

09:56.620 --> 09:59.060
And we want to be able to stop it.

09:59.060 --> 10:01.960
And we want to be able also to spend money on other things.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.560
We don't want to, this is a tremendous amount of money.

10:04.560 --> 10:08.200
And what the Biden administration did was terrible.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.840
They were giving money, but he had no security on the money.

10:10.840 --> 10:13.000
Europe, as you know, gave much less money,

10:13.000 --> 10:13.940
but they had security.

10:13.940 --> 10:15.840
It was in the form of a loan.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.280
They get their money back and we didn't.

10:17.280 --> 10:20.180
And now, at least we're protected

10:20.180 --> 10:22.740
because the American taxpayer has to be protected too.

10:22.740 --> 10:28.820
But this is an incredible agreement for Ukraine

10:28.820 --> 10:32.260
because we have a big investment in their country now.

10:32.260 --> 10:36.400
And what they have, very few people have.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.600
And we're able to really go forward with very,

10:39.600 --> 10:41.840
very high-tech things and many other things,

10:41.840 --> 10:43.400
including weaponry.

10:43.400 --> 10:46.480
Weaponry that we're going to use in many locations,

10:46.480 --> 10:48.680
but that we need for our country.

10:48.680 --> 10:50.820
This allows us to do this.

10:50.820 --> 10:52.980
The President, will you continue?

10:52.980 --> 10:53.980
The President, will you continue?

10:53.980 --> 10:54.980
The President, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10:54.980 --> 10:55.920
I can't get in.

10:55.920 --> 10:56.420
The President, military aid.

10:56.420 --> 10:57.560
The President, yes, go ahead, please.

10:57.560 --> 11:00.360
The President, if I can just add, yes.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.560
In the document, there is one of the very important points.

11:03.560 --> 11:06.400
If we speak about business and investment,

11:06.400 --> 11:09.960
we never had LNG terminals in Ukraine.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.260
This document will open.

11:11.260 --> 11:13.600
I mean, the next document, but anyway,

11:13.600 --> 11:14.980
here we see in the framework,

11:14.980 --> 11:17.840
we see a really good will for this.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.040
LNG terminals for us is very important,

11:20.040 --> 11:23.820
and I think for security of European continent.

11:23.820 --> 11:27.020
We have the biggest storage, gas storage.

11:27.020 --> 11:31.480
We have the biggest in Europe, yes, and we can use it.

11:31.480 --> 11:35.420
UGIS for LNG, use it for LNG, and we will do it.

11:35.420 --> 11:37.760
And really, we can help Europe,

11:37.760 --> 11:39.220
because Europe really helped.

11:39.220 --> 11:43.160
President Trump said that they made less support.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.200
But they have our friends,

11:45.200 --> 11:48.100
and they are our very supportive partners.

11:48.100 --> 11:51.960
They really gave a lot, Mr. President.

11:51.960 --> 11:53.640
They really, they did.

11:53.640 --> 11:54.500
The President, I think, I think.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.300
The President, they gave a lot, but they gave much less.

11:55.300 --> 11:56.500
No.

11:56.500 --> 11:57.100
The President, much less.

11:57.100 --> 11:58.100
No.

11:58.100 --> 11:59.100
No.

11:59.100 --> 12:00.440
The President, don't argue with them.

12:00.440 --> 12:01.440
No.

12:01.440 --> 12:02.440
Okay.

12:02.440 --> 12:03.440
Okay.

12:03.440 --> 12:07.440
The President, can you, can you, can you please?

12:07.440 --> 12:08.440
Yeah, please.

12:08.440 --> 12:12.260
Mr. President Trump, you have repeatedly called

12:12.260 --> 12:15.920
the deal with Ukraine as a historical one.

12:15.920 --> 12:18.300
And as the President of the United States,

12:18.300 --> 12:21.760
you make historical decisions in other issues,

12:21.760 --> 12:24.660
which affect America and other worlds.

12:24.660 --> 12:29.660
So, what place in the world history do you want to take?

12:29.660 --> 12:38.480
And do you associate yourself with any famous historical figures?

12:38.480 --> 12:41.480
The President, I'd say George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.

12:41.480 --> 12:46.040
I would say I'm far superior to George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.

12:46.040 --> 12:48.040
Now, you know I'm only kidding, right?

12:48.040 --> 12:51.040
Because when I say that, the fake news is going to go wild.

12:51.040 --> 12:54.040
They're going to say he considers himself to be better than Washington.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.040
But you never know.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.040
You never know.

12:56.040 --> 12:59.040
I don't compare myself to anybody.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.040
I just, I'm here to do a job.

13:01.040 --> 13:07.040
We've had a great 35 days or whatever it might be, a month, a little more than a month.

13:07.040 --> 13:09.040
We've accomplished tremendous amounts.

13:09.040 --> 13:17.040
Not only this, this would be a very great achievement if we could get the war stopped and get them back to normalization.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.040
I think that's going to happen.

13:18.040 --> 13:21.040
We've had very good talks on both sides, as you know.

13:21.040 --> 13:25.040
But I think we've done a very good job, just generally.

13:25.040 --> 13:31.040
If you look at all of the things we've done in 30 days, they're saying there's never been an opening for a President.

13:31.040 --> 13:36.040
The first month, there's never been a first month like we've had.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.040
And this is one of the very important things.

13:38.040 --> 13:44.040
This, to me, is one of the most important things, because we have tremendous death taking place as we speak.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.040
And I don't want to have that.

13:46.040 --> 13:47.040
You know, think of the parents.

13:47.040 --> 13:48.040
Think of the parents.

13:48.040 --> 13:53.040
Whether they're in Russia or Ukraine, think of the parents of all these people being killed, needlessly.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.040
They came to our territory.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.040
Should have never started.

13:57.040 --> 14:01.040
This would have, if I were President, this would have never started.

14:01.040 --> 14:07.040
Mr. President, will you continue sending military aid?

14:07.040 --> 14:13.040
To Ukraine after the U.S. signed this agreement with Ukraine?

14:13.040 --> 14:14.040
Yeah, we're going to be continuing.

14:14.040 --> 14:15.040
And the question to President Zelensky.

14:15.040 --> 14:19.040
Do you feel like the U.S. is on your side?

14:19.040 --> 14:25.040
That the President Trump is on your side at this, at this moment?

14:25.040 --> 14:26.040
Go ahead.

14:26.040 --> 14:27.040
What do you think?

14:27.040 --> 14:32.040
He wants to know, do you think that, sort of a stupid question.

14:32.040 --> 14:35.040
Because I guess we wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

14:35.040 --> 14:53.040
But I think that the United States, on our side from the very beginning of occupation, and I think that President Trump on our side, and of course, I'm sure that the United States President will not stop support.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.040
This is crucial for us.

14:55.040 --> 14:56.040
It's important for us.

14:56.040 --> 14:57.040
Yes.

14:57.040 --> 15:01.040
And Putin, the President speaks about the people and the soldiers which are dying.

15:01.040 --> 15:02.040
But they came to our territory.

15:02.040 --> 15:03.040
They came to our land.

15:03.040 --> 15:06.040
They began this war, and they have to stop.

15:06.040 --> 15:12.040
And I think this is the question with really the most important question.

15:12.040 --> 15:24.040
Can President Trump, I hope yes, with some other allies, to stop Putin, withdraw these enemies, our enemies, withdraw these troops from our land?

15:24.040 --> 15:27.040
And I think that you asked about the history.

15:27.040 --> 15:32.040
I think that if President Orwell, he will stop Putin.

15:32.040 --> 15:38.040
If President Trump will bring peace to our country, I think he will be on this wall.

15:38.040 --> 15:41.040
We've had very, very good talks.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.040
What about military aid to Ukraine?

15:43.040 --> 15:48.040
President Zelenskyy just said there would be no compromises with Vladimir Putin.

15:48.040 --> 15:52.040
I just wanted to ask both of you.

15:52.040 --> 15:59.040
Firstly, are there compromises that you think that President Zelenskyy is going to have to make?

15:59.040 --> 16:04.040
And, President Zelenskyy, is there anything that you might be thinking that you may be able to offer or bring to the table?

16:04.040 --> 16:05.040
For example, elections?

16:05.040 --> 16:06.040
Thank you.

16:06.040 --> 16:09.340
I think you're going to have to always make compromises.

16:09.340 --> 16:11.720
You can't do any deals without compromises.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.020
So, certainly, he's going to have to make some compromises.

16:14.020 --> 16:17.660
But hopefully, they won't be as big as some people think

16:17.660 --> 16:18.760
you're going to have to make.

16:18.760 --> 16:19.260
That's all.

16:19.260 --> 16:20.080
It's all we can do.

16:20.080 --> 16:23.500
I'm here as an arbitrator, as a mediator, to a certain

16:23.500 --> 16:27.660
extent, between two parties that have been very hostile.

16:27.660 --> 16:29.460
To put it mildly, they've been very hostile.

16:29.460 --> 16:30.760
There's been a vicious war.

16:30.760 --> 16:33.140
There's been a vicious war.

16:33.140 --> 16:34.840
You know, it's a very level battlefield.

16:34.840 --> 16:36.400
And those bullets go out.

16:36.400 --> 16:39.040
And as I've said many times, we were talking about it with

16:39.040 --> 16:42.820
Pete, many times the only thing stopping those bullets

16:42.820 --> 16:44.580
is a human body.

16:44.580 --> 16:47.460
And in the case we're talking about generally young human

16:47.460 --> 16:49.680
bodies are stopping a lot of bullets.

16:49.680 --> 16:50.760
It's dead level.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.460
That's why it's great farmland.

16:52.460 --> 16:53.420
It's great land.

16:53.420 --> 16:54.300
It's great farmland.

16:54.300 --> 16:57.160
But there's very little protection against the

16:57.160 --> 16:59.260
bullets that are being and other things that are being

16:59.260 --> 17:00.400
shot.

17:00.400 --> 17:04.840
So all I can do is see if I can get everybody at

17:04.840 --> 17:06.400
the table and get an agreement.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.980
And I think we're going to end up with an agreement.

17:07.980 --> 17:10.220
Otherwise, I wouldn't probably be even here today.

17:10.220 --> 17:14.620
The Pressure

17:14.620 --> 17:15.620
The Pressure

17:15.620 --> 17:16.620
The Pressure

17:16.620 --> 17:17.620
The Pressure

17:17.620 --> 17:18.620
The Pressure

17:18.620 --> 17:19.620
The Pressure

17:19.620 --> 17:20.620
The Pressure

17:20.620 --> 17:22.080
The Pressure

17:22.080 --> 17:22.360
The Pressure

17:22.360 --> 17:23.260
The Pressure

17:23.260 --> 17:24.460
The Pressure

17:24.460 --> 17:25.400
The Pressure

17:25.400 --> 17:26.460
The Pressure

17:26.460 --> 17:27.400
The Pressure

17:27.400 --> 17:28.320
I hope it will.

17:28.320 --> 17:32.400
I mean, I hope I'm going to be remembered as a peacemaker.

17:32.400 --> 17:36.140
This is, this would be a great thing if we could do this.

17:36.140 --> 17:38.900
I'm doing this to save lives more than anything else.

17:38.900 --> 17:40.640
Second is to save a lot of money.

17:40.640 --> 17:43.640
But I've considered that to be far less important.

17:43.640 --> 17:45.720
So I hope I'm going to thank you, Brian, for that question.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.680
It was a nice question.

17:47.680 --> 17:50.420
I hope I'll be known and recognized as a peacemaker.

17:50.420 --> 17:52.320
This, this would be a great thing to solve.

17:52.320 --> 17:55.460
This is a very dangerous situation.

17:55.460 --> 17:57.820
You know, this could lead to a third world war.

17:57.820 --> 18:01.260
This is, this was headed in the wrong direction.

18:01.260 --> 18:04.860
If this election were lost, if we didn't win this election,

18:04.860 --> 18:06.660
and by, we won it by a lot.

18:06.660 --> 18:07.600
That was a mandate.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.020
We won every swing state.

18:09.020 --> 18:12.300
We won the popular vote by millions and millions of votes.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.100
We won everything.

18:14.100 --> 18:17.240
The districts, you, you look at the areas of, of red.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.440
Take a look at a map.

18:18.440 --> 18:19.700
This was a big mandate.

18:19.700 --> 18:23.040
And this was one of the things I said,

18:23.040 --> 18:25.240
we're going to get this thing settled.

18:25.240 --> 18:27.320
If we didn't win, I think this would have,

18:27.320 --> 18:29.980
this could have very well ended up in a third world war.

18:29.980 --> 18:33.360
And that would not, that would not have been a good situation.

18:33.360 --> 18:34.420
What was your second question?

18:34.420 --> 18:36.420
My second question for President Zelensky.

18:36.420 --> 18:37.420
No.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.520
Do you ever, why don't you wear a suit?

18:39.520 --> 18:40.520
Why?

18:40.520 --> 18:41.520
Sir?

18:41.520 --> 18:42.520
Why don't you wear a suit?

18:42.520 --> 18:44.120
You're the highest level in this country's office,

18:44.120 --> 18:45.960
and you refuse to wear a suit in this country's office,

18:45.960 --> 18:46.960
and you refuse to wear a suit?

18:46.960 --> 18:47.960
You own a suit?

18:47.960 --> 18:49.800
Yeah, you have problems.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.640
A lot of Americans have problems with you.

18:51.640 --> 18:52.300
Really?

18:52.300 --> 18:54.380
I don't have such.

18:54.380 --> 18:58.280
I will wear a costume after this war will finish.

18:58.280 --> 19:03.140
Yes, maybe, maybe something like yours, yes.

19:03.140 --> 19:05.980
Maybe some, something better, I don't know.

19:05.980 --> 19:06.980
We will see.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.080
Maybe something cheaper than, yeah.

19:09.080 --> 19:10.080
Thank you.

19:10.080 --> 19:11.080
Thank you.

19:11.080 --> 19:13.080
Thank you, President.

19:13.080 --> 19:14.080
Thank you, President.

19:14.080 --> 19:17.360
You said, Mr. President, are you going to send more arms

19:17.360 --> 19:20.560
to Ukraine in case there's no peace?

19:20.560 --> 19:23.500
Yeah, we're going to have arms to Ukraine, yeah, sure.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.500
Hopefully I won't have to send very much because

19:25.500 --> 19:27.440
hopefully we're going to have it finished.

19:27.440 --> 19:30.900
We're looking forward to finishing this quickly.

19:30.900 --> 19:33.240
We're not looking forward to sending a lot of arms.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.080
We're looking forward to getting the war finished so

19:35.080 --> 19:38.080
we can do other things.

19:38.080 --> 19:41.020
But we very much appreciate the agreement because we

19:41.020 --> 19:44.720
needed what they had, and we're treating, you know,

19:44.720 --> 19:46.380
our country is now treated fairly.

19:46.380 --> 19:47.360
Biden didn't do that.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.400
Biden didn't, he didn't know what the hell he was doing.

19:49.400 --> 19:50.400
This should have never happened.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.100
This should have never started.

19:52.100 --> 19:56.100
But, you know, sure, the answer is yes, but hopefully

19:56.100 --> 19:59.600
we won't have to send much because I'm looking forward

19:59.600 --> 20:03.480
to get it done, getting it done quickly, very quickly.

20:03.480 --> 20:05.320
Does that still provide security guarantees,

20:05.320 --> 20:06.820
Mr. President?

20:06.820 --> 20:08.920
I don't want to talk about security yet because I

20:08.920 --> 20:10.020
want to get the deal done.

20:10.020 --> 20:12.320
You know, you fall into the same trap like everybody

20:12.320 --> 20:15.260
else a million times you said over and over, I want to

20:15.260 --> 20:17.300
get the deal done, security is so easy.

20:17.300 --> 20:20.000
That's about 2 percent of the problem.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.440
I'm not worried about security.

20:21.440 --> 20:23.740
I'm worried about getting the deal done.

20:23.740 --> 20:25.340
The security is the easy part.

20:25.340 --> 20:26.700
Security is very nice.

20:26.700 --> 20:28.480
Everybody stop shooting.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.040
And now, will Europe put people there?

20:30.040 --> 20:31.880
I know France is going to.

20:31.880 --> 20:33.920
I know the UK is going to.

20:33.920 --> 20:35.920
I know other countries are going to, and they happen

20:35.920 --> 20:37.280
to be right next door.

20:37.280 --> 20:39.360
We haven't committed, but we could conceivably.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.760
You know, we have security in a different form.

20:41.760 --> 20:45.100
We'll have workers there digging, digging, digging,

20:45.100 --> 20:48.860
taking the raw earth so that we can create a lot of

20:48.860 --> 20:51.640
great product in this country.

20:51.640 --> 20:53.240
So, in that sense, you have something.

20:53.240 --> 20:55.240
But we haven't determined that yet.

20:55.240 --> 20:58.380
I will say, in speaking to France and in speaking to

20:58.380 --> 21:01.320
the, and they were here, as you know, last week and

21:01.320 --> 21:07.080
just the other day, they have committed to a lot of security.

21:07.080 --> 21:08.660
I don't think you're going to need much security.

21:08.660 --> 21:11.260
I think once this deal gets done, it's over.

21:11.260 --> 21:13.640
Russia is not going to want to go back and nobody's

21:13.640 --> 21:14.840
going to want to go back.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.500
When this, when this deal ends, I really believe this

21:17.500 --> 21:19.640
deal is, is going to be over.

21:19.640 --> 21:20.980
Question.

21:20.980 --> 21:21.540
Yeah.

21:21.540 --> 21:22.300
Please go ahead.

21:22.300 --> 21:23.080
Go ahead, please.

21:23.080 --> 21:23.480
Yeah.

21:23.480 --> 21:24.680
The Press, President, thank you.

21:24.680 --> 21:25.580
The Press, President, thank you.

21:25.580 --> 21:26.840
The Press, President Macron and Keir Starmer at the

21:26.840 --> 21:29.220
White House this past week, both whom praised your

21:29.220 --> 21:32.080
courage and conviction to lead the pathway towards peace.

21:32.080 --> 21:33.760
The Press, President Macron and Keir Starmer

21:33.760 --> 21:34.580
Thank you.

21:34.580 --> 21:35.580
Part of that involved, though, reengaging with Russia

21:35.580 --> 21:37.760
in diplomatic relations, something that previous leaders

21:37.760 --> 21:39.420
lack the conviction to do so.

21:39.420 --> 21:41.500
What gave you the moral courage and conviction

21:41.500 --> 21:42.860
to step forward and lead that?

21:42.860 --> 21:44.860
The President Biden Well, I love this guy.

21:44.860 --> 21:45.800
Who are you with?

21:45.800 --> 21:46.700
The Press 1 American News, sir.

21:46.700 --> 21:48.340
The President Biden Well, that's why I like him.

21:48.340 --> 21:50.180
One American News does a great job.

21:50.180 --> 21:52.180
It's very, I like the question.

21:52.180 --> 21:53.900
I think it's a very good question.

21:53.900 --> 21:56.180
It is, it's a pathway to peace.

21:56.180 --> 21:59.480
It's a pathway to getting something solved.

21:59.480 --> 22:01.560
And I feel that as the head of this country,

22:01.560 --> 22:03.420
I have an obligation to do that.

22:03.420 --> 22:05.660
Plus, you know, we're very much involved.

22:05.660 --> 22:08.160
We got involved.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.160
It's too bad we got involved because there should have

22:10.160 --> 22:12.700
been no involvement because there should have been no war.

22:12.700 --> 22:15.060
And there shouldn't have been October 7th.

22:15.060 --> 22:16.180
That would have never happened.

22:16.180 --> 22:17.980
As you know, Iran was broke.

22:17.980 --> 22:19.880
They had no money to give to Hezbollah.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.180
They had no money to give to Hamas.

22:22.180 --> 22:24.480
They were stone cold broke.

22:24.480 --> 22:27.640
And then under Biden, they became rich as hell.

22:27.640 --> 22:32.820
They went from no money to $300 billion in a period

22:32.820 --> 22:34.480
of four years.

22:34.480 --> 22:36.080
And they gave a lot of that money away.

22:36.080 --> 22:37.120
And you see what happened.

22:37.120 --> 22:41.560
And that's a real mess also that we hope to be able to solve.

22:41.560 --> 22:44.420
But, no, I appreciate your question very much.

22:44.420 --> 22:48.460
I just, I feel I have an obligation to try and do

22:48.460 --> 22:50.960
something to stop the death.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.660
The President Trump Jr.: If I can, if I can answer.

22:52.660 --> 22:53.860
Yes, if I can answer.

22:53.860 --> 22:54.660
The President Trump Jr.: Please, go ahead.

22:54.660 --> 22:55.940
The President Trump Jr.: Please, please.

22:55.940 --> 22:57.440
The President Trump Jr.: And I do like your clothing, by the way.

22:57.440 --> 22:58.300
The President Trump Jr.: Yeah, really?

22:58.300 --> 22:59.400
The President Trump Jr.: Even though I have to,

22:59.400 --> 23:00.980
I think he's a great guy, by the way.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.780
The President Trump Jr.: And I don't know if you two like

23:02.780 --> 23:03.580
each other.

23:03.580 --> 23:04.520
But you know what?

23:04.520 --> 23:06.020
The President Trump Jr.: I think he's dressed beautiful.

23:06.020 --> 23:06.760
I like this guy.

23:06.760 --> 23:07.260
I don't like him.

23:07.260 --> 23:08.060
The President Trump Jr.: I think he's dressed beautifully.

23:08.060 --> 23:11.800
The President Trump Jr.: So I have more serious things than

23:11.800 --> 23:12.700
answer on such question.

23:12.700 --> 23:13.520
The President Trump Jr.: That's true.

23:13.520 --> 23:14.700
The President Trump Jr.: I will answer on more serious

23:14.700 --> 23:15.920
questions if I can.

23:15.920 --> 23:16.460
The President Trump Jr.: That's a good statement.

23:16.460 --> 23:17.100
The President Trump Jr.: Yeah.

23:17.100 --> 23:18.100
So, please.

23:18.100 --> 23:21.900
about security guarantees and about justice fire.

23:21.900 --> 23:25.180
We can't just speak about this fire and speak and speak.

23:25.180 --> 23:26.680
It will not work.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.940
Justice fire will not never work

23:28.940 --> 23:30.980
because I'm like a president.

23:30.980 --> 23:34.180
I have this experience and not only me.

23:34.180 --> 23:37.560
Ukraine, before my presidency from the 2014,

23:37.560 --> 23:41.120
Putin broken 25 times.

23:41.120 --> 23:46.620
25 times he broken his own signature.

23:46.620 --> 23:48.520
Twenty-five times he broken his fire.

23:48.520 --> 23:50.060
But he never broke to me.

23:50.060 --> 23:50.800
He never broke to me.

23:50.800 --> 23:52.400
No, no, you were the president.

23:52.400 --> 23:54.360
He never broke to me.

23:54.360 --> 23:57.540
In 2016, you've been the president, Mr. President.

23:57.540 --> 24:01.240
You've been the president, but he had, of course, not with you,

24:01.240 --> 24:03.500
but he had, during those periods,

24:03.500 --> 24:05.980
he had conversations with our side,

24:05.980 --> 24:08.040
and we had Normandy format, you know,

24:08.040 --> 24:10.340
the France, Germany, Ukraine, and Russia,

24:10.340 --> 24:12.380
and he broken 25 times.

24:12.380 --> 24:16.380
That's why we will never accept just his fire.

24:16.380 --> 24:18.980
It will not work without security guarantees.

24:18.980 --> 24:21.920
Security guarantees, maybe the president is right

24:21.920 --> 24:23.980
about this document and other,

24:23.980 --> 24:25.720
but this document is not enough.

24:25.720 --> 24:29.060
Strong army is enough because his soldiers are afraid.

24:29.060 --> 24:31.260
Putin's soldiers are afraid of our soldiers

24:31.260 --> 24:32.500
when we're strong enough.

24:32.500 --> 24:35.260
If we are not strong enough, if we are empty,

24:35.260 --> 24:39.640
if our storage is empty, we can't defend our land.

24:39.640 --> 24:42.240
Today, you know, he knows that we have,

24:42.240 --> 24:44.640
all the world knows that we have meeting, yes?

24:44.640 --> 24:46.720
Why he's using ballistic?

24:46.720 --> 24:49.420
Putin today using ballistic on our hospitals,

24:49.420 --> 24:51.920
schools, and et cetera, ballistic.

24:51.920 --> 24:53.480
So he knows that we are here,

24:53.480 --> 24:55.360
and that President Trump is really,

24:55.360 --> 24:59.160
have good will to stop, to stop this war.

24:59.160 --> 25:01.720
And you hear now, the president,

25:01.720 --> 25:04.600
so why he's using, so he doesn't want to stop.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.860
He doesn't want, but I hope that we will do it,

25:06.860 --> 25:08.160
really, we'll do it.

25:08.160 --> 25:10.860
Security, when we speak about security guarantees,

25:10.860 --> 25:14.160
when the Europeans are ready for contingents,

25:14.160 --> 25:18.000
they need USA backstop.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.840
If there will not be United States,

25:19.840 --> 25:21.940
we will never have any contingents,

25:21.940 --> 25:23.980
strong contingents from the Europeans,

25:23.980 --> 25:26.280
because they don't want to divide alliance,

25:26.280 --> 25:28.340
connection between the United States,

25:28.340 --> 25:32.760
the main and strongest alliance, and Europeans.

25:32.760 --> 25:34.820
This is crucial, this is important.

25:34.820 --> 25:37.760
That's what we want to speak about very much.

25:37.760 --> 25:38.960
This is very important.

25:38.960 --> 25:42.960
And air defense, so air defense,

25:42.960 --> 25:45.540
really we have big deficits with all the systems,

25:45.540 --> 25:49.500
and we need to provide this, we need it very much.

25:49.500 --> 25:52.240
Otherwise, Putin will never stop,

25:52.240 --> 25:53.700
and we'll go further and further.

25:53.700 --> 25:56.580
He doesn't want, he'll hate us, you know?

25:56.580 --> 25:58.720
It's not about me, he hates Ukrainians.

25:58.720 --> 26:01.360
He thinks that we are not a nation.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.220
He thinks, and he shares this source,

26:03.220 --> 26:05.380
I think maybe with your team also, I don't know.

26:05.380 --> 26:08.820
But with all the Europeans in media, officially and not,

26:08.820 --> 26:13.860
he always said that there is no such country, such nation,

26:13.860 --> 26:17.100
such language, and such life like Ukrainian.

26:17.100 --> 26:21.320
No, he really doesn't respect all the Ukrainians,

26:21.320 --> 26:24.940
and he wants to destroy us.

26:24.940 --> 26:29.140
And you are right, Mr. President, that's 2%.

26:29.140 --> 26:31.780
This document, maybe other documents.

26:31.780 --> 26:33.720
It's a very good start, very good,

26:33.720 --> 26:37.920
but it will not enough to stop this person.

26:37.920 --> 26:38.980
Should Russia pay to...

26:38.980 --> 26:41.860
Mr. President, may I have one more question, please?

26:41.860 --> 26:42.680
Yeah, go ahead.

26:42.680 --> 26:43.680
I asked the President...

26:43.680 --> 26:45.020
They have to pay this question.

26:45.020 --> 26:47.720
This is the rule, this is the rule of the war.

26:47.720 --> 26:49.320
This is the rule of the war.

26:49.320 --> 26:51.460
During all the centuries, all the history,

26:51.460 --> 26:52.900
this is the rule of the war.

26:52.900 --> 26:56.600
Who began those pay?

26:56.600 --> 26:57.400
This is the rule.

26:57.400 --> 26:58.780
Putin began this war.

26:58.780 --> 27:01.380
He has to pay all money for innovation.

27:01.380 --> 27:02.480
He has to pay.

27:02.480 --> 27:04.240
Of course, some Russian assets,

27:04.240 --> 27:08.820
what we have in Europe, about 300 billions,

27:08.820 --> 27:10.480
we can use them.

27:10.480 --> 27:11.680
We can use it for innovation

27:11.680 --> 27:14.760
and buy military support from the United States also.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.620
We can do it, but it's not enough.

27:17.620 --> 27:18.620
It's not enough.

27:18.620 --> 27:23.260
I asked this question that you didn't like because I wanted to know...

27:23.260 --> 27:25.120
Go ahead, please, wait one second.

27:25.120 --> 27:27.520
I asked this question that you didn't like

27:27.520 --> 27:31.200
because I wanted to know if you want to position yourself

27:31.200 --> 27:35.300
in the middle between Russia and Ukraine or on the Ukraine side.

27:35.300 --> 27:36.540
No, I'm in the middle.

27:36.540 --> 27:37.780
I want to solve this thing.

27:37.780 --> 27:39.300
I'm for both.

27:39.300 --> 27:41.080
I want to get it solved.

27:41.080 --> 27:46.380
And it's wonderful to speak badly about somebody else,

27:46.380 --> 27:48.620
but I want to get it solved.

27:48.620 --> 27:49.980
If we can solve it, great.

27:49.980 --> 27:52.260
If we can't solve it, they're going to have to fight it out

27:52.260 --> 27:54.580
and who knows what's going to happen.

27:54.580 --> 27:56.420
But I want to see it get solved.

27:56.420 --> 27:57.600
May I follow up?

27:57.600 --> 28:00.720
One more question about U.S. troops in Europe.

28:00.720 --> 28:04.300
After the Russian invasion of Ukraine,

28:04.300 --> 28:07.440
your predecessor sent additional troops to Eastern Europe,

28:07.440 --> 28:09.140
including Poland, my country.

28:09.140 --> 28:09.740
Yeah.

28:09.740 --> 28:13.540
Are you committed to keeping these troops

28:13.540 --> 28:18.840
on the eastern flank of NATO in the future?

28:18.840 --> 28:21.020
I'm very committed to Poland.

28:21.020 --> 28:23.080
I think Poland has really stepped up

28:23.080 --> 28:24.460
and done a great job for NATO.

28:24.460 --> 28:27.320
They, as you know, they paid more than they had to.

28:27.320 --> 28:31.820
They are one of the finest groups of people I've ever known.

28:31.820 --> 28:33.500
I'm very committed to Poland.

28:33.500 --> 28:34.120
What about the Baltic?

28:34.120 --> 28:35.820
Poland's in a tough neighborhood, you know.

28:35.820 --> 28:38.300
What about the Baltics?

28:38.300 --> 28:44.000
The Baltics, they got a lot of, it's a tough neighborhood, too.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.040
But we're committed.

28:45.040 --> 28:46.380
We're going to be very committed.

28:46.380 --> 28:48.340
And we're committed to NATO.

28:48.340 --> 28:49.640
But NATO has to step up.

28:49.640 --> 28:52.380
And the Europeans have to step up more than they have.

28:52.380 --> 28:53.820
And I want to see them equalized,

28:53.820 --> 28:56.960
because they are in for far less than we're in.

28:56.960 --> 28:59.120
And they should be at least equal.

28:59.120 --> 29:00.380
You understand that.

29:00.380 --> 29:03.360
Why is the United States, we have an ocean in between.

29:03.360 --> 29:05.720
Why is the United States in for so much more money,

29:05.720 --> 29:08.660
and other things, as Europe?

29:08.660 --> 29:10.620
With that being said, and as you said,

29:10.620 --> 29:13.160
they've also been obviously very helpful.

29:13.160 --> 29:16.060
But we have put in far more than they have.

29:16.060 --> 29:18.460
And I think they should equalize.

29:18.460 --> 29:20.300
The Pressure on the agenda.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.300
The Pressure on the agenda.

29:22.300 --> 29:23.880
What changed between the first time

29:23.880 --> 29:26.780
that Secretary Besant gave President Zelensky

29:26.780 --> 29:28.600
the agreement and today for the signing?

29:28.600 --> 29:30.580
The President Obama's agenda.

29:30.580 --> 29:32.620
The Pressure on the agenda.

29:32.620 --> 29:33.740
The President Obama's agenda.

29:33.740 --> 29:35.720
The President Obama's agenda.

29:35.720 --> 29:38.760
I didn't think we were going to make a deal.

29:38.760 --> 29:41.600
And we ended up making the deal,

29:41.600 --> 29:43.100
so that changed.

29:43.100 --> 29:44.500
The Pressure on the agenda.

29:44.500 --> 29:46.400
What and how do you envision a trilateral summit

29:46.400 --> 29:47.440
with President Zelensky ?

29:47.440 --> 29:48.440
The President Obama's agenda?

29:48.440 --> 29:49.040
The President Obama's agenda.

29:49.040 --> 29:49.640
President Obama's agenda.

29:49.640 --> 29:50.300
I don't know, but it's-

29:50.300 --> 29:51.400
The President Obama's agenda,

29:51.400 --> 29:52.100
but they don't like each other, I can tell you that.

29:52.100 --> 29:52.800
Okay?

29:52.800 --> 29:53.680
The President Obama's agenda

29:53.680 --> 29:54.700
versus the Latest Scheune.

29:54.700 --> 29:54.780
The President Obama's agenda.

29:54.780 --> 29:55.780
The President Obama's agenda.

29:55.780 --> 29:57.540
They don't like, okay?

29:57.540 --> 29:59.900
The Almost economy.

29:59.900 --> 30:01.500
The President Obama's agenda.

30:01.500 --> 30:02.380
The President Obama's agenda.

30:02.380 --> 30:03.440
The President Obama's agenda shortly thereafter.

30:03.440 --> 30:08.480
United States, run by a man that didn't know much.

30:08.480 --> 30:10.320
I'm going to be very nice.

30:10.320 --> 30:13.120
Run by an incompetent person.

30:13.120 --> 30:14.820
Very incompetent person.

30:14.820 --> 30:17.320
Should never have allowed this to happen.

30:17.320 --> 30:18.160
I've stopped wars.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.860
I've stopped many wars.

30:19.860 --> 30:21.800
My people will tell you, I stopped wars that nobody

30:21.800 --> 30:22.620
ever heard about.

30:22.620 --> 30:25.320
I stopped wars before they ever started.

30:25.320 --> 30:28.560
You can look at some of the, some of, I could give

30:28.560 --> 30:30.440
you a lot of nations that would tell you right now

30:30.440 --> 30:31.760
they were probably going to war.

30:31.760 --> 30:34.600
I could tell you right now there's a nation thinking

30:34.600 --> 30:37.740
about going to war on something that nobody in this

30:37.740 --> 30:39.440
room has ever even heard about.

30:39.440 --> 30:41.100
Two smaller nations, but big.

30:41.100 --> 30:42.680
Still big.

30:42.680 --> 30:45.180
And I think I've stopped it.

30:45.180 --> 30:47.180
But this should have never happened.

30:47.180 --> 30:49.040
The Pressure President, do you want to talk about

30:49.040 --> 30:54.040
about any negotiations?

30:54.040 --> 30:57.120
First of all, I want really to tell you, and I think

30:57.120 --> 31:00.860
that everybody understands that Ukraine, more than

31:00.860 --> 31:03.600
Ukrainians, nobody wants to stop this war.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.640
But in the future, any negotiations, it's

31:06.640 --> 31:12.700
understandable that two sides of the war, not Russia and

31:12.700 --> 31:15.140
the United States, because this is not the war between

31:15.140 --> 31:16.580
Russia and the United States.

31:16.580 --> 31:19.420
This is a war of Russia against Ukraine and

31:19.420 --> 31:20.240
Ukrainian people.

31:20.240 --> 31:24.740
So these two sides will be at any, anyway, will be at the

31:24.740 --> 31:27.220
negotiation, a negotiation table.

31:27.220 --> 31:31.720
Then, of course, United States, like the strongest partner of

31:31.720 --> 31:33.080
the Ukraine.

31:33.080 --> 31:34.760
And, of course, Europe.

31:34.760 --> 31:36.420
I think Europe is very important.

31:36.420 --> 31:39.020
I want to speak about it with the President.

31:39.020 --> 31:42.500
Yes, Europe is very important for us because we really defend

31:42.500 --> 31:43.500
Europe for today.

31:43.500 --> 31:48.240
All the Europeans really recognize that we are defending

31:48.240 --> 31:51.800
the line, and they have real life, and our people are dying.

31:51.800 --> 31:54.040
That's why they helped us.

31:54.040 --> 31:56.320
And also, it's about the nature.

31:56.320 --> 32:00.420
Yes, between, like the President said, you have big, nice

32:00.420 --> 32:01.620
ocean.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.580
Yes, between us.

32:03.580 --> 32:07.400
But if we will not stay, Russia will go further to

32:07.400 --> 32:09.560
Baltics and to Poland, by the way.

32:09.560 --> 32:10.860
But first to the Baltics.

32:10.860 --> 32:15.360
It's understandable for them because they've been in the

32:15.360 --> 32:19.140
USSR, you know, they've been one of the republics of the

32:19.140 --> 32:23.200
USSR, and Putin wants to bring them back to his empire.

32:23.200 --> 32:24.100
It's a fact.

32:24.100 --> 32:27.100
And when he will go there, if we will not stay, you will

32:27.100 --> 32:28.040
fight.

32:28.040 --> 32:31.480
Your American soldiers, it doesn't matter.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.580
Do you have ocean or not?

32:33.580 --> 32:35.420
Your soldiers will fight.

32:35.420 --> 32:37.420
Mr. President, would you be willing to visit Ukraine?

32:37.420 --> 32:40.180
The cave or Odessa, which is known to be a 30-year

32:40.180 --> 32:41.180
liberal class?

32:41.180 --> 32:42.180
The President, it was my question.

32:42.180 --> 32:46.180
The President, I don't want to talk about Odessa now.

32:46.180 --> 32:47.680
Let's not talk about Odessa.

32:47.680 --> 32:50.860
I want to talk about making a deal, getting peace.

32:50.860 --> 32:53.000
We don't have to talk about Odessa.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.120
But a lot of cities have been destroyed.

32:55.120 --> 32:58.040
There are a lot of cities that are not recognizable.

32:58.040 --> 32:59.740
There's not a building standing.

32:59.740 --> 33:01.740
And a lot of things have happened.

33:01.740 --> 33:03.900
Mr. President, you have to come and to look.

33:03.900 --> 33:04.740
No, no, no.

33:04.740 --> 33:06.500
We have very good cities.

33:06.500 --> 33:08.420
Yes, a lot of things have been destroyed.

33:08.420 --> 33:11.520
But mostly cities alive.

33:11.520 --> 33:12.880
And people work.

33:12.880 --> 33:14.220
And children go to school.

33:14.220 --> 33:15.480
Sometimes it's very difficult.

33:15.480 --> 33:17.860
Sometimes closer to front line.

33:17.860 --> 33:21.320
Children have to go to underground schools or online.

33:21.320 --> 33:23.020
But we live.

33:23.020 --> 33:24.160
Ukraine is fighting.

33:24.160 --> 33:25.660
And Ukraine lives.

33:25.660 --> 33:27.260
This is very important.

33:27.260 --> 33:29.600
And maybe it's Putin is sharing this information

33:29.600 --> 33:32.000
that he destroyed us.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.840
He lost 700,000 people.

33:34.840 --> 33:38.100
700,000 soldiers he lost in Eversi.

33:38.100 --> 33:39.300
Yes.

33:39.300 --> 33:43.280
Mr. President, when did you last speak with President Putin?

33:43.280 --> 33:44.440
Please, go ahead.

33:44.440 --> 33:46.640
Mr. When did you last speak with President Putin?

33:46.640 --> 33:47.580
And what did he say that he did?

33:47.580 --> 33:48.540
A couple of days ago.

33:48.540 --> 33:50.620
And what did he tell you that gave you the assurance

33:50.620 --> 33:52.280
that he wanted peace?

33:52.280 --> 33:53.120
Well, that's what I do.

33:53.120 --> 33:54.420
My whole life is deals.

33:54.420 --> 33:57.080
I know pretty good.

33:57.080 --> 34:00.280
And I really, I've known him for a long time.

34:00.280 --> 34:02.380
I've dealt with him for a long time.

34:02.380 --> 34:05.080
He had to suffer through the Russia hoax.

34:05.080 --> 34:06.260
You know, Russia, Russia, Russia.

34:06.260 --> 34:07.420
It was a hoax.

34:07.420 --> 34:08.300
It was all Biden.

34:08.300 --> 34:10.060
It was nothing to do with him.

34:10.060 --> 34:11.500
So he had to suffer through that.

34:11.500 --> 34:14.060
And he was able to do that.

34:14.060 --> 34:16.200
I think that he wants to make a deal.

34:16.200 --> 34:18.800
And he would like to see it end.

34:18.800 --> 34:19.500
That's all I do.

34:19.500 --> 34:20.100
That's what I do.

34:20.100 --> 34:22.300
My whole life, that's what I do is make deals.

34:22.300 --> 34:24.640
And I'm in the middle of a mess.

34:24.640 --> 34:26.820
Because this is a real mess.

34:26.820 --> 34:28.720
It's a very dangerous one.

34:28.720 --> 34:33.120
If this doesn't get solved now, it's not going to get solved for a long time.

34:33.120 --> 34:35.120
So I hope we're going to get it solved.

34:35.120 --> 34:36.000
In the back, please.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
The Press.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
The Press.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
The Press.

34:39.000 --> 34:52.980
Well, we actually spoke to him about that yesterday, and we thought they took it very, very much too far.

34:52.980 --> 34:53.980
JD was very strong on it.

34:53.980 --> 34:54.280
So was I.

34:54.280 --> 34:54.880
So was Marco.

34:54.880 --> 34:59.280
And we've been speaking to him about it.

34:59.280 --> 35:01.280
Marco, would you like to say something about it?

35:01.280 --> 35:07.580
Yeah, we have concerns, obviously, with the conduct of various, particularly as it impacts Americans.

35:07.580 --> 35:11.280
And there's real concern that American speech, which is online, could fall into the hands of the British or any country's jurisdiction.

35:11.280 --> 35:21.280
And so this is a point the Vice President made in Munich, and I think it's a very compelling one that unites us with Europe, as much as anything else, is these shared values, and one of them being free speech.

35:21.280 --> 35:28.280
And so Americans are threatened by it. We're going to need to take action in that regard.

35:28.280 --> 35:31.280
It's a very important question.

35:31.280 --> 35:38.280
We spoke about this in detail with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary and others at lunch yesterday, and I know that they are going to be a very important question.

35:38.280 --> 35:42.280
It's a big question.

35:42.280 --> 35:47.280
We spoke about this in detail with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary and others at lunch yesterday.

35:47.280 --> 35:55.280
And I know that the Secretary of Commerce, Lutnik, followed up in private meetings last night.

35:55.280 --> 35:57.280
This is really important.

35:57.280 --> 36:01.280
We believe Americans have the right to speak their mind, even if we in this room disagree with them.

36:01.280 --> 36:06.280
They have the right to speak their mind in the public square, which is often online these days.

36:06.280 --> 36:12.280
And we're going to defend that right as it pertains to American companies and American citizens vigorously if we have to.

36:12.280 --> 36:18.280
I do think that under the President's leadership, we're going to find common ground with our friends in the UK on this question.

36:18.280 --> 36:20.280
But it remains to be seen.

36:20.280 --> 36:26.280
The principle that will guide us is we believe in free speech in this country and we'll fight for it for American citizens.

36:26.280 --> 36:30.280
Mr. President, on the deal, is there any other oil and gas component to the deal?

36:30.280 --> 36:31.280
Is it all critical?

36:31.280 --> 36:32.280
A little bit. We'll see.

36:32.280 --> 36:33.280
On LNG?

36:33.280 --> 36:38.280
Mr. But we're not really looking for that so much. We've got a lot. We have more than anybody in the world by far.

36:38.280 --> 36:44.280
So, no, we're not talking about it too much, but a little bit. I think it affects also. But for the most part, no.

36:44.280 --> 36:53.280
And, sir, is there any agreement from Ukraine to purchase US LNG as part of the deal? Or is that on the table at all?

36:53.280 --> 36:55.280
Mr. No. We don't need that.

36:55.280 --> 37:00.280
Mr. President, I just wanted to ask you about, you just mentioned that you'd spoken to Vladimir Putin a couple of days ago.

37:00.280 --> 37:04.280
Just to be clear, that's a new call, not the one that you're talking about.

37:04.280 --> 37:06.280
Mr. I've spoken to him on numerous occasions.

37:06.280 --> 37:11.280
Okay. And how was the latest call? And what did you discuss? How did it go?

37:11.280 --> 37:13.280
Mr. Are you serious with that question?

37:13.280 --> 37:14.280
Mr. I am. I'd love to know.

37:14.280 --> 37:17.280
Mr. It went well. I think we're going to have a deal.

37:17.280 --> 37:23.280
On the minerals deal, Mr. President, some of those minerals are in the east of Ukraine, not far from the front lines.

37:23.280 --> 37:24.280
And in areas that Russia's .

37:24.280 --> 37:26.280
Mr. A very good question. Thank you so much.

37:26.280 --> 37:29.280
Does President Putin withdraw his forces from those areas if there are U.S. interests?

37:29.280 --> 37:37.280
Mr. Well, we'll take a look at the time. We have a lot of area. It's a very big area we're talking about. So, we'll take a look. I'll study that, and I'll see.

37:37.280 --> 37:42.280
And who would protect those minerals if they are U.S. interests? Would that be a U.S. interest?

37:42.280 --> 37:45.280
Mr. They'll be protected. The agreement will protect them.

37:45.280 --> 37:47.280
The agreement, yeah. We're signing an agreement.

37:47.280 --> 37:51.280
Mr. So, there is a big deal, but what if Russia tries to invade or orders Russian and Russia into a spy?

37:51.280 --> 37:53.280
Mr. I just told you, I don't think that's going to happen.

37:53.280 --> 37:55.240
And if that were going to happen, I wouldn't make a deal.

37:55.240 --> 37:58.720
If I thought that was going to happen, I wouldn't make a deal.

37:58.720 --> 38:02.260
You know, they ought to focus on CNN, on survival,

38:02.260 --> 38:05.660
not asking me these ridiculous questions.

38:05.660 --> 38:08.800
Focus on surviving, because CNN has got such low ratings,

38:08.800 --> 38:11.440
I don't think they're going to survive.

38:11.440 --> 38:12.660
Let's go.

38:12.660 --> 38:13.860
Yeah, please, go ahead.

38:13.860 --> 38:14.860
One more.

38:14.860 --> 38:17.400
Since I already mentioned Poland,

38:17.400 --> 38:20.940
Poland was under Russian control for decades

38:20.940 --> 38:22.840
after the Second World War.

38:22.840 --> 38:25.600
When I was a kid, I looked at the United States,

38:25.600 --> 38:31.040
not only as a most powerful country, richest country in the world,

38:31.040 --> 38:35.680
the country that has great music, great movies, great muscle cars,

38:35.680 --> 38:39.400
but also as a force for good.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.920
Do you, and now I'm talking with my friends in Poland,

38:41.920 --> 38:46.860
and they are worried that you align yourself too much with Putin.

38:46.860 --> 38:50.360
What's your message for them?

38:50.360 --> 38:53.660
Well, if I didn't align myself with both of them,

38:53.660 --> 38:55.560
you'd never have a deal.

38:55.560 --> 38:59.360
You want me to say really terrible things about Putin,

38:59.360 --> 39:02.180
and then say, hi, Vladimir, how are we doing on the deal?

39:02.180 --> 39:03.800
That doesn't work that way.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.240
I'm not aligned with Putin.

39:05.240 --> 39:06.540
I'm not aligned with anybody.

39:06.540 --> 39:08.840
I'm aligned with the United States of America,

39:08.840 --> 39:11.280
and for the good of the world.

39:11.280 --> 39:14.360
I'm aligned with the world, and I want to get this thing over with.

39:14.360 --> 39:16.200
You see the hatred he's got for Putin.

39:16.200 --> 39:18.740
It's very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate.

39:18.740 --> 39:21.440
He's got tremendous hatred, and I understand that,

39:21.440 --> 39:25.640
but I can tell you the other side isn't exactly in love with,

39:25.640 --> 39:28.040
you know, him either.

39:28.040 --> 39:30.180
So it's not a question of alignment.

39:30.180 --> 39:32.940
I have to, I'm aligned with the world.

39:32.940 --> 39:34.040
I want to get the thing set.

39:34.040 --> 39:36.540
I'm aligned with Europe.

39:36.540 --> 39:39.480
I want to see if we can get this thing done.

39:39.480 --> 39:40.580
You want me to be tough?

39:40.580 --> 39:43.120
I could be tougher than any human being you've ever seen.

39:43.120 --> 39:45.120
I'd be so tough.

39:45.120 --> 39:46.720
But you're never going to get a deal that way.

39:46.720 --> 39:48.280
So that's the way it goes.

39:48.280 --> 39:49.360
All right, one more question.

39:49.360 --> 39:50.720
Yeah, please.

39:50.720 --> 39:51.720
The President, I want to respond to this.

39:51.720 --> 39:54.620
So, look, for four years in the United States of America,

39:54.620 --> 39:57.060
we had a President who stood up at press conferences

39:57.060 --> 39:59.400
and talked tough about Vladimir Putin,

39:59.400 --> 40:01.400
and then Putin invaded Ukraine

40:01.400 --> 40:04.080
and destroyed a significant chunk of the country.

40:04.080 --> 40:07.440
The path to peace and the path to prosperity

40:07.440 --> 40:10.280
is maybe engaging in diplomacy.

40:10.280 --> 40:12.980
We tried the pathway of Joe Biden,

40:12.980 --> 40:15.360
of thumping our chest and pretending

40:15.360 --> 40:17.920
that the President of the United States' words

40:17.920 --> 40:21.120
mattered more than the President of the United States' actions.

40:21.120 --> 40:23.020
What makes America a good country

40:23.020 --> 40:25.260
is America engaging in diplomacy.

40:25.260 --> 40:26.860
That's what President Trump is doing.

40:26.860 --> 40:28.660
Can I ask you?

40:28.660 --> 40:29.200
Sure.

40:29.200 --> 40:29.740
Yeah?

40:29.740 --> 40:30.300
Yeah.

40:30.300 --> 40:31.100
Okay.

40:31.100 --> 40:36.800
So he occupied it, our parts, big parts of Ukraine,

40:36.800 --> 40:40.140
parts of East and Crimea.

40:40.140 --> 40:43.580
So he occupied it on 2014.

40:43.580 --> 40:48.660
So during a lot of years, I'm not speaking about just Biden,

40:48.660 --> 40:52.820
but those time was Obama, then President Obama,

40:52.820 --> 40:55.020
then President Trump, then President Biden,

40:55.020 --> 40:57.620
and now President Trump, and God bless,

40:57.620 --> 40:59.660
now President Trump will stop him.

40:59.660 --> 41:02.360
But during 2014, nobody stopped him.

41:02.360 --> 41:04.260
He just occupied and took.

41:04.260 --> 41:05.200
He killed people.

41:05.200 --> 41:06.400
You know what the contact line?

41:06.400 --> 41:08.200
2015.

41:08.200 --> 41:08.900
2014.

41:08.900 --> 41:09.640
2014.

41:09.640 --> 41:10.300
2014.

41:10.300 --> 41:10.900
Yeah, yeah.

41:10.900 --> 41:11.640
So he killed-

41:11.640 --> 41:12.500
I was not here.

41:12.500 --> 41:12.900
Yeah, but-

41:12.900 --> 41:13.840
That's exactly right.

41:13.840 --> 41:20.640
Yes, but during 2014 till 2022, was the situation the same?

41:20.640 --> 41:24.120
That people have been dying on the contact line.

41:24.120 --> 41:25.620
Nobody stopped him.

41:25.620 --> 41:28.520
You know that we had conversations with him,

41:28.520 --> 41:31.360
a lot of conversations, my bilateral conversation,

41:31.360 --> 41:35.300
and we signed with him, me, like a new president.

41:35.300 --> 41:39.140
In 2019, I signed with him the deal.

41:39.140 --> 41:41.940
I signed with him, Macron, and Merkel.

41:41.940 --> 41:44.840
We signed a ceasefire, ceasefire.

41:44.840 --> 41:48.520
All of them told me that he will never go.

41:48.520 --> 41:52.680
We signed him a gas contract, gas contract.

41:52.680 --> 41:56.120
Yes, but after that, he broke the ceasefire.

41:56.120 --> 41:59.920
He killed our people, and he didn't exchange prisoners.

41:59.920 --> 42:04.260
We signed the exchange of prisoners, but he didn't do it.

42:04.260 --> 42:07.500
What kind of diplomacy, J.D., you are speaking about?

42:07.500 --> 42:09.640
What do you mean?

42:09.640 --> 42:11.400
I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy

42:11.400 --> 42:13.160
that's going to end the destruction of your country.

42:13.160 --> 42:14.300
Yes, but if you are not strong-

42:14.300 --> 42:15.880
Mr. President, Mr. President, with respect,

42:15.880 --> 42:18.300
I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office

42:18.300 --> 42:20.580
and try to litigate this in front of the American media.

42:20.580 --> 42:24.040
Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts

42:24.040 --> 42:26.920
to the front lines because you have manpower problems.

42:26.920 --> 42:30.060
You should be thanking the President for trying to bring it into this conflict.

42:30.060 --> 42:33.360
Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have?

42:33.360 --> 42:34.660
I have been to-

42:34.660 --> 42:35.320
Come once.

42:35.320 --> 42:41.620
I have actually watched and seen the stories, and I know that what happens is you bring people,

42:41.620 --> 42:44.620
you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President.

42:44.620 --> 42:48.140
Do you disagree that you've had problems bringing people into your military?

42:48.140 --> 42:49.140
We have problems.

42:49.140 --> 42:53.380
Do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America

42:53.380 --> 42:57.680
and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?

42:57.680 --> 42:59.140
A lot of questions.

42:59.140 --> 43:00.320
Let's start from the beginning.

43:00.320 --> 43:01.320
Sure.

43:01.320 --> 43:04.480
First of all, during the war, everybody has problems.

43:04.480 --> 43:05.480
Even you.

43:05.480 --> 43:08.360
But you have nice ocean, and don't feel now.

43:08.360 --> 43:10.560
But you will feel it in the future.

43:10.560 --> 43:11.560
God bless.

43:11.560 --> 43:12.560
You don't know that.

43:12.560 --> 43:13.560
God bless.

43:13.560 --> 43:14.900
You will not have a war.

43:14.900 --> 43:16.640
Don't tell us what we're going to feel.

43:16.640 --> 43:18.200
We're trying to solve a problem.

43:18.200 --> 43:19.800
Don't tell us what we're going to feel.

43:19.800 --> 43:20.800
I'm not telling you.

43:20.800 --> 43:21.800
I'm not saying on this question.

43:21.800 --> 43:22.800
Because you're in no position to dictate that.

43:22.800 --> 43:23.800
Remember this.

43:23.800 --> 43:27.980
You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel.

43:27.980 --> 43:29.480
We're going to feel very good.

43:29.480 --> 43:30.680
You will feel influenced.

43:30.680 --> 43:32.980
We're going to feel very good and very strong.

43:32.980 --> 43:33.980
I'm telling you.

43:33.980 --> 43:34.980
You will feel influenced.

43:34.980 --> 43:36.720
You're right now not in a very good position.

43:36.720 --> 43:40.660
You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position, and he happens to be right about it.

43:40.660 --> 43:43.720
From the very beginning of the war, Mr. President, you're not in a good position.

43:43.720 --> 43:46.480
You don't have the cards right now.

43:46.480 --> 43:47.480
With us, you start having cards.

43:47.480 --> 43:48.480
I'm not playing cards.

43:48.480 --> 43:49.480
But right now, you don't.

43:49.480 --> 43:50.480
You're playing cards.

43:50.480 --> 43:51.480
I'm very serious, Mr. President.

43:51.480 --> 43:52.480
You're playing cards.

43:52.480 --> 43:53.480
I'm very serious.

43:53.480 --> 43:54.480
I'm the president in war.

43:54.480 --> 43:55.480
You're gambling with the lives of millions of people.

43:55.480 --> 43:56.480
You're gambling with World War III.

43:56.480 --> 43:57.480
What else?

43:57.480 --> 43:58.480
What are you thinking about?

43:58.480 --> 44:00.540
You're gambling with World War III.

44:00.540 --> 44:04.540
And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country.

44:04.540 --> 44:05.540
This country.

44:05.540 --> 44:06.540
It's back to you.

44:06.540 --> 44:07.540
I'm with all respect to your country.

44:07.540 --> 44:09.540
Far more than a lot of people said they should have.

44:09.540 --> 44:11.540
Have you said thank you once this entire meeting?

44:11.540 --> 44:12.540
A lot of times.

44:12.540 --> 44:17.160
So, in this entire meeting that you said thank you, you went to Pennsylvania and campaigned

44:17.160 --> 44:19.500
for the opposition in October.

44:19.500 --> 44:23.840
Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's

44:23.840 --> 44:26.300
trying to save your country.

44:26.300 --> 44:28.440
Please.

44:28.440 --> 44:32.300
You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war, you can speak.

44:32.300 --> 44:33.300
He's not speaking loudly.

44:33.300 --> 44:34.920
He's not speaking loudly.

44:34.920 --> 44:36.040
Your country is in big trouble.

44:36.040 --> 44:37.040
Can I answer?

44:37.040 --> 44:38.040
Wait a minute.

44:38.040 --> 44:39.040
There's a lot of talking.

44:39.040 --> 44:40.660
Your country is in big trouble.

44:40.660 --> 44:41.660
I know.

44:41.660 --> 44:42.660
I know.

44:42.660 --> 44:43.660
You're not winning.

44:43.660 --> 44:44.660
You're not winning this.

44:44.660 --> 44:47.660
You have a damn good chance of coming out okay because of us.

44:47.660 --> 44:49.340
Mr. President, we are staying in our country.

44:49.340 --> 44:52.000
Staying strong from the very beginning of the war.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.220
We've been alone.

44:53.220 --> 44:54.220
And we are thankful.

44:54.220 --> 44:55.220
I said thanks.

44:55.220 --> 44:56.220
You haven't been alone.

44:56.220 --> 44:57.220
Not only in this cabinet.

44:57.220 --> 45:01.220
We gave you, through the stupid president, $350 billion.

45:01.220 --> 45:02.220
You voted for your president.

45:02.220 --> 45:03.220
We gave you military equipment.

45:03.220 --> 45:04.220
You voted for your president.

45:04.220 --> 45:05.220
And you men are brave.

45:05.220 --> 45:06.220
But they had to use our military.

45:06.220 --> 45:07.220
Yes.

45:07.220 --> 45:08.220
What about West?

45:08.220 --> 45:09.220
If you didn't have our military equipment.

45:09.220 --> 45:10.220
You invited me.

45:10.220 --> 45:11.220
You invited me to speak.

45:11.220 --> 45:15.220
If you didn't have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.

45:15.220 --> 45:16.220
In three days.

45:16.220 --> 45:17.220
I heard it from Putin.

45:17.220 --> 45:18.220
In three days.

45:18.220 --> 45:19.220
This is something new.

45:19.220 --> 45:20.220
Maybe less.

45:20.220 --> 45:21.220
In two weeks.

45:21.220 --> 45:22.220
Of course, yes.

45:22.220 --> 45:24.220
It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this.

45:24.220 --> 45:26.220
I tell you, just say thank you.

45:26.220 --> 45:29.220
I said a lot of times thank you to American people.

45:29.220 --> 45:31.220
Except that there are disagreements.

45:31.220 --> 45:36.220
And let's go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it out in the American

45:36.220 --> 45:37.220
media when you're wrong.

45:37.220 --> 45:38.220
We know that you're wrong.

45:38.220 --> 45:42.220
But you see, I think it's good for the American people to see what's going on over here.

45:42.220 --> 45:43.220
I think it's very important.

45:43.220 --> 45:45.220
That's why I kept this going so long.

45:45.220 --> 45:47.220
You have to be thankful.

45:47.220 --> 45:48.220
You don't have the cards.

45:48.220 --> 45:49.220
I'm thankful.

45:49.220 --> 45:50.220
You're buried there.

45:50.220 --> 45:52.220
Your people are dying.

45:52.220 --> 45:53.220
I can tell you.

45:53.220 --> 45:54.220
You're running low on soldiers.

45:54.220 --> 45:55.220
I know.

45:55.220 --> 45:56.220
Don't, please.

45:56.220 --> 45:57.220
You're running low on soldiers.

45:57.220 --> 45:58.220
It would be a damn good thing.

45:58.220 --> 45:59.220
Mr. President.

45:59.220 --> 46:01.220
Then you tell us, I don't want a ceasefire.

46:01.220 --> 46:02.220
I don't want a ceasefire.

46:02.220 --> 46:03.220
I want to go.

46:03.220 --> 46:04.220
And I wanted this.

46:04.220 --> 46:09.220
Look, if you could get a ceasefire right now, I'd tell you, you'd take it.

46:09.220 --> 46:12.220
So the bullets stop flying and your men stop getting killed.

46:12.220 --> 46:13.220
Of course, we want to stop the war.

46:13.220 --> 46:14.220
But I said to you.

46:14.220 --> 46:15.220
But I said to you.

46:15.220 --> 46:16.220
With guarantees.

46:16.220 --> 46:17.220
With guarantees.

46:17.220 --> 46:19.220
Because you'll get a ceasefire faster than an agreement.

46:19.220 --> 46:21.220
Ask our people about ceasefire.

46:21.220 --> 46:22.220
What do they think?

46:22.220 --> 46:24.220
It doesn't matter for you what it means.

46:24.220 --> 46:25.220
It wasn't with me.

46:25.220 --> 46:26.220
It wasn't with you.

46:26.220 --> 46:29.220
That was with a guy named Biden, who was not a smart person.

46:29.220 --> 46:30.220
That was with Obama.

46:30.220 --> 46:31.220
This is your president.

46:31.220 --> 46:32.220
It was your president.

46:32.220 --> 46:33.220
Excuse me.

46:33.220 --> 46:35.220
That was with Obama, who gave you sheets.

46:35.220 --> 46:36.220
And I gave you javelins.

46:36.220 --> 46:37.220
Yes.

46:37.220 --> 46:40.220
I gave you the javelins to take out all those tanks.

46:40.220 --> 46:42.220
Obama gave you sheets.

46:42.220 --> 46:47.220
In fact, the statement is, Obama gave sheets and Trump gave javelins.

46:47.220 --> 46:50.220
You got to be more thankful.

46:50.220 --> 46:52.220
Because let me tell you, you don't have the cards.

46:52.220 --> 46:54.220
With us, you have the cards.

46:54.220 --> 46:56.220
But without us, you don't have any cards.

46:56.220 --> 46:59.220
One more question to Mr. Vice President.

46:59.220 --> 47:00.220
I'm sorry.

47:00.220 --> 47:02.220
It's going to be a tough deal to make.

47:02.220 --> 47:04.220
Because the attitudes have to change.

47:04.220 --> 47:07.220
What if Russia breaks this fire?

47:07.220 --> 47:09.220
What if Russia breaks these talks?

47:09.220 --> 47:10.220
What do you do then?

47:10.220 --> 47:14.220
I understand that it's a heated conversation right now.

47:14.220 --> 47:15.220
What are you saying?

47:15.220 --> 47:18.220
She's asking what if Russia breaks the ceasefire?

47:18.220 --> 47:20.220
What if they, what if anything?

47:20.220 --> 47:23.220
What if a bomb drops on your head right now?

47:23.220 --> 47:24.220
Okay?

47:24.220 --> 47:25.220
What if they broke it?

47:25.220 --> 47:26.220
I don't know.

47:26.220 --> 47:27.220
They broke it with Biden.

47:27.220 --> 47:29.220
Because Biden, they didn't respect him.

47:29.220 --> 47:30.220
They didn't respect Obama.

47:30.220 --> 47:32.220
They respect me.

47:32.220 --> 47:35.220
Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me.

47:35.220 --> 47:38.220
He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia,

47:38.220 --> 47:40.220
Russia, Russia, Russia.

47:40.220 --> 47:41.220
You ever hear of that deal?

47:41.220 --> 47:46.220
That was a phony, that was a phony Hunter Biden, Joe Biden scam.

47:46.220 --> 47:49.220
Hillary Clinton, Shifty Adam Schiff.

47:49.220 --> 47:51.220
It was a Democrat scam.

47:51.220 --> 47:53.220
And he had to go through that.

47:53.220 --> 47:54.220
And he did go through it.

47:54.220 --> 47:56.220
We didn't end up in a war.

47:56.220 --> 47:57.220
And he went through it.

47:57.220 --> 47:58.220
He was accused of all that stuff.

47:58.220 --> 47:59.220
He had nothing to do with it.

47:59.220 --> 48:01.220
It came out of Hunter Biden's bathroom.

48:01.220 --> 48:06.220
It came out of Hunter Biden's bedroom.

48:06.220 --> 48:08.220
It was disgusting.

48:08.220 --> 48:14.220
And then they said, oh, oh, the laptop from hell was made by Russia.

48:14.220 --> 48:16.220
The 51 agents.

48:16.220 --> 48:18.220
The whole thing was a scam.

48:18.220 --> 48:19.220
And he had to put up with that.

48:19.220 --> 48:21.220
He was being accused of all that stuff.

48:21.220 --> 48:23.220
All I can say is this.

48:23.220 --> 48:27.220
He might have broken deals with Obama and Bush.

48:27.220 --> 48:29.220
And he might have broken them with Biden.

48:29.220 --> 48:30.220
He did, maybe.

48:30.220 --> 48:31.220
Maybe he didn't.

48:31.220 --> 48:32.220
I don't know what happened.

48:32.220 --> 48:33.220
But he didn't break them with me.

48:33.220 --> 48:34.220
He wants to make a deal.

48:34.220 --> 48:36.220
I don't know if you can make a deal.

48:36.220 --> 48:40.220
The problem is, I've empowered you to be a tough guy.

48:40.220 --> 48:44.220
And I don't think you'd be a tough guy without the United States.

48:44.220 --> 48:46.220
And your people are very brave.

48:46.220 --> 48:49.220
But you're either going to make a deal or we're out.

48:49.220 --> 48:52.220
And if we're out, you'll fight it out.

48:52.220 --> 48:54.220
I don't think it's going to be pretty.

48:54.220 --> 48:55.220
But you'll fight it out.

48:55.220 --> 48:57.220
But you don't have the cards.

48:57.220 --> 49:01.220
But once we sign that deal, you're in a much better position.

49:01.220 --> 49:03.220
But you're not acting at all thankful.

49:03.220 --> 49:04.220
And that's not a nice thing.

49:04.220 --> 49:05.220
I'll be honest.

49:05.220 --> 49:06.220
That's not a nice thing.

49:06.220 --> 49:07.220
All right.

49:07.220 --> 49:09.220
I think we've seen enough.

49:09.220 --> 49:10.220
What do you think?

49:10.220 --> 49:13.220
This is going to be great television.

49:13.220 --> 49:14.220
I will say that.

49:14.220 --> 49:16.220
All right.

49:16.220 --> 49:19.220
We'll see what we can do about putting it together.

49:19.220 --> 49:21.220
Thank you.

49:21.220 --> 49:22.220
Thanks.
