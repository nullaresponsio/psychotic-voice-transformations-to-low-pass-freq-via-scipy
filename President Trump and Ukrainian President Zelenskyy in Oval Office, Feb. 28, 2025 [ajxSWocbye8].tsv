660	1600	The President, thank you very much.
1600	5740	It's an honor to have President Zelensky of Ukraine.
5740	8340	And we've been working very hard, very close.
8340	10380	So we've actually known each other for a long time.
10380	12720	We've been dealing with each other for a long time
12720	14640	and very well.
14640	17060	We had a little negotiation spat,
17060	20080	but that worked out great, I think, for both countries.
20080	23600	I think for the world, actually, beyond both countries.
23600	28060	And we have something that is a very fair deal.
28060	30960	And we look forward to getting in and digging,
30960	32440	digging, digging, and working
32440	35300	and getting some of the rare earth.
35300	36860	But it means we're going to be inside.
36860	40240	And it's a big commitment from the United States.
40240	43740	And we appreciate working with you very much.
43740	45840	And we will continue to do that.
45840	49340	We have had some very good discussions with Russia.
49340	51780	I spoke with President Putin.
51780	54060	And we're going to try and bring this to a close.
54060	55880	It's something that you want and that he wants.
55880	58060	We have to negotiate a deal.
58060	60300	But we've started the confines of a deal.
60300	63860	And I think something can happen.
63860	67960	The big thing is the number of soldiers,
67960	70280	mostly at this point, but soldiers being killed.
70280	72000	You're losing thousands of soldiers.
72000	74000	On both sides, we're losing a lot of soldiers.
74000	76480	And we want to see it stop.
76480	79780	And we want to see the money get put to different kinds of use,
79780	82280	like rebuilding, the rebuilding.
82280	84880	And we're going to be working very hard.
84880	87160	But we've had a lot of very good conversations.
87160	90840	I will say until we came along, the Biden administration
90840	92840	didn't speak to Russia whatsoever.
92840	93840	They didn't speak to anybody.
93840	96740	They just allowed this to continue.
96740	100640	And I will say that I'll say in front of you,
100640	102740	you've heard me say it a thousand times.
102740	105080	If I were President, this war would have never happened.
105080	106920	We would have had a deal negotiated for you
106920	110860	without having to go through what you've gone through.
110860	114220	But you, your soldiers have been unbelievably brave.
114220	115560	We've given them great equipment,
115560	117360	but they've, somebody has to use the equipment.
117360	120240	They've been unbelievably brave.
120240	121860	And we give them great credit.
121860	124480	This was supposed to be over very quickly.
124480	127700	And here we are three years later.
127700	130740	So I give tremendous credit to your generals
130740	133580	and your soldiers and yourself in the sense
133580	138420	that it's been very hard fighting, very tough fighting.
138420	140280	They're great fighters.
140280	143460	And you have to be very proud of them from that standpoint.
143460	145460	But now we want to get it over with.
145460	147820	It's enough, right, if we want to get it over with.
147820	150560	So it's an honor to have you here.
150560	151760	Thank you very much for coming.
151760	156260	We're going to sign the agreement at the conference
156260	160640	in the East Room in a little while, right after lunch.
160640	162060	And we'll be having lunch together.
162060	165040	We're also discussing some other things.
165040	167040	And we appreciate everybody being here.
167040	169580	It's a, somewhat of an exciting moment.
169580	172500	But the really exciting moment is when we get a,
172500	174920	when they stop the shooting and we end up with a deal.
174920	176780	And I think we're fairly close to getting that.
176780	178980	And an honor to have you.
178980	181480	And please, would you like to say something?
181480	182620	The President Trump Jr.: No, thank you so much,
182620	183620	Mr. President.
183620	185760	Thank you for your invitation.
185760	190960	And really, I hope that this document, first document,
190960	194100	will be a first step to real security guarantees for Ukraine,
194100	196100	our people, our children.
196100	197800	I really count on it.
197800	201580	And of course, we count that America will not stop support.
201580	204720	Really, for us, it's very important to support
204720	206320	and to continue it.
206320	210520	I want to discuss it with details further during our conversation
210520	213920	and, of course, the infrastructure or security guarantees.
213920	217720	Because for today, I understand what Europe is ready to do.
217720	220520	And of course, I want to discuss with you what United States
220520	222260	will be ready to do.
222260	226340	And I really count on your strong position to stop Putin.
226340	229540	And you said that enough with the war.
229540	233680	I think that is very important, Ben, to say these words to Putin
233680	234680	at the very beginning.
234680	238020	At the very beginning of war, because he's a killer and terrorist.
238020	240980	But I hope that together we can stop him.
240980	246780	But for us, it's very important to save our country, our values,
246780	249480	our freedom and democracy.
249480	254260	And of course, no compromises with the killer about our territories.
254260	256000	But it will be later.
256000	259660	And of course, what I wanted, you know we spoke about it by phone
259660	261900	with you about the drones production.
261900	263560	We have very good drones production.
263560	267340	I think the best one in the world for today because of the war.
267340	272320	Yes, and of course, we need very much the air defense.
272320	274480	You have the best air defense in the world.
274480	277780	And really, you helped us under attacks of Russians.
277780	281160	And I want to speak how we can exchange the licenses.
281160	285120	We're open to share the licenses of all our drones with you,
285120	286460	of course, with the United States.
286460	289900	And we need licenses for quick production of air defense.
289900	294060	Even after the war, we need our nation to be calm,
294060	295100	that we are secure.
295100	297740	So that's why we need this air shield.
297740	302640	And of course, about this, I want to speak about the contingents.
302640	306580	I think that France and UK already spoke to you.
306580	309840	And we know that Europe is ready, but without the United States,
309840	314580	they will not be ready to be as strong as we need.
314580	318960	And the last point, last not least, about exchange,
318960	321200	about our people and children.
321200	326180	And you know that this crazy Russian that they've stolen 20,000 of children,
326180	329000	Ukrainian children, they changed their names.
329000	332480	They changed their, you know, their families, relatives.
332480	334520	And now they're in Russia.
334520	336520	We want to bring them back.
336520	340360	And really, it's a big, big dream, task and goal for me.
340360	345400	And our warriors, we, by the way, Mr. President, we brought,
345400	350240	we exchanged, we, yes, released more than 4,000 warriors
350240	355000	from Russian prison, but there are thousands more in the prison.
355000	360280	I wanted to share with you some, some images, how, how,
360280	362840	just, just, can I, can I now?
362840	364120	Yeah, please, please.
364120	370320	One minute, one minute, just you to understand what, in what circumstances,
370320	374840	in what situation they are, and what the attitude of Russia to our prisons.
374840	379700	That, guys, just you, before, before and after.
379700	383000	And you see, before and after, just you to understand.
383000	387440	Now, thousands of such guys, ladies and men, there.
387440	392120	And that, so they don't eat, they beat them, and they, you know,
392120	396520	they do a lot of, a lot of, you know, bad things.
396520	399960	So, out of, even during the war, there are rules.
399960	402520	Everybody knows, there are rules during the war.
402520	406000	These guys, they don't have any rules, you see that.
406000	411000	50, 60 kilograms left, and a lot of such things.
411000	416240	And I didn't want to show you what, what the changes with images of children,
416240	419040	because I will share, just share with you.
419040	422320	And, I mean, it's looking tragic.
422320	423720	Yep, that's tough stuff.
423720	428160	Yeah, yeah, I wanted very much to, to give you, and you, you see.
428160	428760	Yeah.
428760	430460	This is pastor, by the way.
430460	433260	They stolen pastors, because it's not Russian church.
433260	436600	They stolen pastors and moved pastors to the prison.
436600	441360	We, at the end of last year, we, we brought three pastors,
441360	444660	and we, we could exchange them.
444660	447260	This is pastor, you see.
447260	448740	Yeah, that's tough.
448740	452560	Yeah, so, I mean, this, I wanted to show you, and this.
452560	453900	So, thank you very much.
453900	455180	We want to get that ended, right?
455180	457140	Yeah, yeah, of course, we, of course, we want to.
457140	457980	And I think we will.
457980	459580	I think we will.
459580	460380	And, uh...
460380	461720	We have to, of course.
461720	462940	Do you have any questions, please?
462940	466080	When you continue, to ask you about, Mr. President,
466080	466880	just a quick question.
466880	468080	Thank you, Mr. President.
468080	469620	We think that, how much money is the U.S.
469620	472020	going to put into the fund that is being created today?
472020	475620	And how does this provide long-term security for Ukraine?
475620	477360	Well, we don't know exactly how much,
477360	480460	because we're going to be putting some money in a fund
480460	482660	that we're going to get from the raw earth
482660	486400	that we're going to be taking and sharing in terms of revenue.
486400	488540	So, it's going to be a lot of money will be made
488540	491140	from the sale and from the use of raw earth.
491140	493980	And, as you know, our country doesn't have much raw earth.
493980	496680	We have a lot of oil and gas,
496680	499520	but we don't have a lot of the raw earth.
499520	503020	And what we do have is protected by the environmentalists,
503020	504360	but that could be unprotected.
504360	506960	But still, it's not very much.
506960	511060	They have among the best in the world, in terms of raw earth.
511060	514700	So, we're going to be using that, taking it,
514700	516540	using it for all of the things we do,
516540	520280	including AI and including weapons and the military.
520280	523720	And it's really going to very much satisfy our needs.
523720	526820	So, something that just worked out really well.
526820	528780	We have a lot of oil and we have a lot of gas.
528780	530680	We have a lot, but we don't have raw earth.
530680	535680	So, this has just about every component of the raw earth
535680	539360	that we need for computers, for all of the things we do.
539360	540620	This puts us in great shape.
540620	542620	The Press Presser and the long-term security program.
542620	543620	How is this provided?
543620	545360	The President Biden I think they're going to have great long.
545360	546740	I think once we make the agreement,
546740	548500	that's going to be 95 percent of it.
548500	551440	It's, they're not going to go back to fighting.
551440	553640	I've spoken with President Putin.
553640	556340	And I think, I mean, I feel very strong.
556340	558080	I've known them for a long time.
558080	562440	And I feel very strongly that they're very serious about it.
562440	563580	And we'll make a deal.
563580	565640	And when the deal is made, I don't think,
565640	566780	we talk about security.
566780	568180	Everyone's talking about the other day,
568180	569460	all they talked about was security.
569460	571580	I said, let me make the deal first.
571580	572800	I have to make the deal first.
572800	574260	I don't worry about security right now.
574260	576100	I have to, we have to have a deal.
576100	580640	Because right now, last week, 2,000 soldiers died on both sides.
580640	585920	2,000 and they're losing 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 a week.
585920	587380	So as we sit here and we talk,
587380	590920	people are getting shot and dying on the battlefield.
590920	593360	And you know, they're not American soldiers,
593360	596620	but they're Russian soldiers and they're Ukrainian soldiers.
596620	599060	And we want to be able to stop it.
599060	601960	And we want to be able also to spend money on other things.
601960	604560	We don't want to, this is a tremendous amount of money.
604560	608200	And what the Biden administration did was terrible.
608200	610840	They were giving money, but he had no security on the money.
610840	613000	Europe, as you know, gave much less money,
613000	613940	but they had security.
613940	615840	It was in the form of a loan.
615840	617280	They get their money back and we didn't.
617280	620180	And now, at least we're protected
620180	622740	because the American taxpayer has to be protected too.
622740	628820	But this is an incredible agreement for Ukraine
628820	632260	because we have a big investment in their country now.
632260	636400	And what they have, very few people have.
636400	639600	And we're able to really go forward with very,
639600	641840	very high-tech things and many other things,
641840	643400	including weaponry.
643400	646480	Weaponry that we're going to use in many locations,
646480	648680	but that we need for our country.
648680	650820	This allows us to do this.
650820	652980	The President, will you continue?
652980	653980	The President, will you continue?
653980	654980	The President, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
654980	655920	I can't get in.
655920	656420	The President, military aid.
656420	657560	The President, yes, go ahead, please.
657560	660360	The President, if I can just add, yes.
660360	663560	In the document, there is one of the very important points.
663560	666400	If we speak about business and investment,
666400	669960	we never had LNG terminals in Ukraine.
669960	671260	This document will open.
671260	673600	I mean, the next document, but anyway,
673600	674980	here we see in the framework,
674980	677840	we see a really good will for this.
677840	680040	LNG terminals for us is very important,
680040	683820	and I think for security of European continent.
683820	687020	We have the biggest storage, gas storage.
687020	691480	We have the biggest in Europe, yes, and we can use it.
691480	695420	UGIS for LNG, use it for LNG, and we will do it.
695420	697760	And really, we can help Europe,
697760	699220	because Europe really helped.
699220	703160	President Trump said that they made less support.
703160	705200	But they have our friends,
705200	708100	and they are our very supportive partners.
708100	711960	They really gave a lot, Mr. President.
711960	713640	They really, they did.
713640	714500	The President, I think, I think.
714500	715300	The President, they gave a lot, but they gave much less.
715300	716500	No.
716500	717100	The President, much less.
717100	718100	No.
718100	719100	No.
719100	720440	The President, don't argue with them.
720440	721440	No.
721440	722440	Okay.
722440	723440	Okay.
723440	727440	The President, can you, can you, can you please?
727440	728440	Yeah, please.
728440	732260	Mr. President Trump, you have repeatedly called
732260	735920	the deal with Ukraine as a historical one.
735920	738300	And as the President of the United States,
738300	741760	you make historical decisions in other issues,
741760	744660	which affect America and other worlds.
744660	749660	So, what place in the world history do you want to take?
749660	758480	And do you associate yourself with any famous historical figures?
758480	761480	The President, I'd say George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.
761480	766040	I would say I'm far superior to George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.
766040	768040	Now, you know I'm only kidding, right?
768040	771040	Because when I say that, the fake news is going to go wild.
771040	774040	They're going to say he considers himself to be better than Washington.
774040	775040	But you never know.
775040	776040	You never know.
776040	779040	I don't compare myself to anybody.
779040	781040	I just, I'm here to do a job.
781040	787040	We've had a great 35 days or whatever it might be, a month, a little more than a month.
787040	789040	We've accomplished tremendous amounts.
789040	797040	Not only this, this would be a very great achievement if we could get the war stopped and get them back to normalization.
797040	798040	I think that's going to happen.
798040	801040	We've had very good talks on both sides, as you know.
801040	805040	But I think we've done a very good job, just generally.
805040	811040	If you look at all of the things we've done in 30 days, they're saying there's never been an opening for a President.
811040	816040	The first month, there's never been a first month like we've had.
816040	818040	And this is one of the very important things.
818040	824040	This, to me, is one of the most important things, because we have tremendous death taking place as we speak.
824040	826040	And I don't want to have that.
826040	827040	You know, think of the parents.
827040	828040	Think of the parents.
828040	833040	Whether they're in Russia or Ukraine, think of the parents of all these people being killed, needlessly.
833040	835040	They came to our territory.
835040	837040	Should have never started.
837040	841040	This would have, if I were President, this would have never started.
841040	847040	Mr. President, will you continue sending military aid?
847040	853040	To Ukraine after the U.S. signed this agreement with Ukraine?
853040	854040	Yeah, we're going to be continuing.
854040	855040	And the question to President Zelensky.
855040	859040	Do you feel like the U.S. is on your side?
859040	865040	That the President Trump is on your side at this, at this moment?
865040	866040	Go ahead.
866040	867040	What do you think?
867040	872040	He wants to know, do you think that, sort of a stupid question.
872040	875040	Because I guess we wouldn't be here if I wasn't.
875040	893040	But I think that the United States, on our side from the very beginning of occupation, and I think that President Trump on our side, and of course, I'm sure that the United States President will not stop support.
893040	895040	This is crucial for us.
895040	896040	It's important for us.
896040	897040	Yes.
897040	901040	And Putin, the President speaks about the people and the soldiers which are dying.
901040	902040	But they came to our territory.
902040	903040	They came to our land.
903040	906040	They began this war, and they have to stop.
906040	912040	And I think this is the question with really the most important question.
912040	924040	Can President Trump, I hope yes, with some other allies, to stop Putin, withdraw these enemies, our enemies, withdraw these troops from our land?
924040	927040	And I think that you asked about the history.
927040	932040	I think that if President Orwell, he will stop Putin.
932040	938040	If President Trump will bring peace to our country, I think he will be on this wall.
938040	941040	We've had very, very good talks.
941040	943040	What about military aid to Ukraine?
943040	948040	President Zelenskyy just said there would be no compromises with Vladimir Putin.
948040	952040	I just wanted to ask both of you.
952040	959040	Firstly, are there compromises that you think that President Zelenskyy is going to have to make?
959040	964040	And, President Zelenskyy, is there anything that you might be thinking that you may be able to offer or bring to the table?
964040	965040	For example, elections?
965040	966040	Thank you.
966040	969340	I think you're going to have to always make compromises.
969340	971720	You can't do any deals without compromises.
971720	974020	So, certainly, he's going to have to make some compromises.
974020	977660	But hopefully, they won't be as big as some people think
977660	978760	you're going to have to make.
978760	979260	That's all.
979260	980080	It's all we can do.
980080	983500	I'm here as an arbitrator, as a mediator, to a certain
983500	987660	extent, between two parties that have been very hostile.
987660	989460	To put it mildly, they've been very hostile.
989460	990760	There's been a vicious war.
990760	993140	There's been a vicious war.
993140	994840	You know, it's a very level battlefield.
994840	996400	And those bullets go out.
996400	999040	And as I've said many times, we were talking about it with
999040	1002820	Pete, many times the only thing stopping those bullets
1002820	1004580	is a human body.
1004580	1007460	And in the case we're talking about generally young human
1007460	1009680	bodies are stopping a lot of bullets.
1009680	1010760	It's dead level.
1010760	1012460	That's why it's great farmland.
1012460	1013420	It's great land.
1013420	1014300	It's great farmland.
1014300	1017160	But there's very little protection against the
1017160	1019260	bullets that are being and other things that are being
1019260	1020400	shot.
1020400	1024840	So all I can do is see if I can get everybody at
1024840	1026400	the table and get an agreement.
1026400	1027980	And I think we're going to end up with an agreement.
1027980	1030220	Otherwise, I wouldn't probably be even here today.
1030220	1034620	The Pressure
1034620	1035620	The Pressure
1035620	1036620	The Pressure
1036620	1037620	The Pressure
1037620	1038620	The Pressure
1038620	1039620	The Pressure
1039620	1040620	The Pressure
1040620	1042080	The Pressure
1042080	1042360	The Pressure
1042360	1043260	The Pressure
1043260	1044460	The Pressure
1044460	1045400	The Pressure
1045400	1046460	The Pressure
1046460	1047400	The Pressure
1047400	1048320	I hope it will.
1048320	1052400	I mean, I hope I'm going to be remembered as a peacemaker.
1052400	1056140	This is, this would be a great thing if we could do this.
1056140	1058900	I'm doing this to save lives more than anything else.
1058900	1060640	Second is to save a lot of money.
1060640	1063640	But I've considered that to be far less important.
1063640	1065720	So I hope I'm going to thank you, Brian, for that question.
1065720	1067680	It was a nice question.
1067680	1070420	I hope I'll be known and recognized as a peacemaker.
1070420	1072320	This, this would be a great thing to solve.
1072320	1075460	This is a very dangerous situation.
1075460	1077820	You know, this could lead to a third world war.
1077820	1081260	This is, this was headed in the wrong direction.
1081260	1084860	If this election were lost, if we didn't win this election,
1084860	1086660	and by, we won it by a lot.
1086660	1087600	That was a mandate.
1087600	1089020	We won every swing state.
1089020	1092300	We won the popular vote by millions and millions of votes.
1092300	1094100	We won everything.
1094100	1097240	The districts, you, you look at the areas of, of red.
1097240	1098440	Take a look at a map.
1098440	1099700	This was a big mandate.
1099700	1103040	And this was one of the things I said,
1103040	1105240	we're going to get this thing settled.
1105240	1107320	If we didn't win, I think this would have,
1107320	1109980	this could have very well ended up in a third world war.
1109980	1113360	And that would not, that would not have been a good situation.
1113360	1114420	What was your second question?
1114420	1116420	My second question for President Zelensky.
1116420	1117420	No.
1117420	1119520	Do you ever, why don't you wear a suit?
1119520	1120520	Why?
1120520	1121520	Sir?
1121520	1122520	Why don't you wear a suit?
1122520	1124120	You're the highest level in this country's office,
1124120	1125960	and you refuse to wear a suit in this country's office,
1125960	1126960	and you refuse to wear a suit?
1126960	1127960	You own a suit?
1127960	1129800	Yeah, you have problems.
1129800	1131640	A lot of Americans have problems with you.
1131640	1132300	Really?
1132300	1134380	I don't have such.
1134380	1138280	I will wear a costume after this war will finish.
1138280	1143140	Yes, maybe, maybe something like yours, yes.
1143140	1145980	Maybe some, something better, I don't know.
1145980	1146980	We will see.
1146980	1149080	Maybe something cheaper than, yeah.
1149080	1150080	Thank you.
1150080	1151080	Thank you.
1151080	1153080	Thank you, President.
1153080	1154080	Thank you, President.
1154080	1157360	You said, Mr. President, are you going to send more arms
1157360	1160560	to Ukraine in case there's no peace?
1160560	1163500	Yeah, we're going to have arms to Ukraine, yeah, sure.
1163500	1165500	Hopefully I won't have to send very much because
1165500	1167440	hopefully we're going to have it finished.
1167440	1170900	We're looking forward to finishing this quickly.
1170900	1173240	We're not looking forward to sending a lot of arms.
1173240	1175080	We're looking forward to getting the war finished so
1175080	1178080	we can do other things.
1178080	1181020	But we very much appreciate the agreement because we
1181020	1184720	needed what they had, and we're treating, you know,
1184720	1186380	our country is now treated fairly.
1186380	1187360	Biden didn't do that.
1187360	1189400	Biden didn't, he didn't know what the hell he was doing.
1189400	1190400	This should have never happened.
1190400	1192100	This should have never started.
1192100	1196100	But, you know, sure, the answer is yes, but hopefully
1196100	1199600	we won't have to send much because I'm looking forward
1199600	1203480	to get it done, getting it done quickly, very quickly.
1203480	1205320	Does that still provide security guarantees,
1205320	1206820	Mr. President?
1206820	1208920	I don't want to talk about security yet because I
1208920	1210020	want to get the deal done.
1210020	1212320	You know, you fall into the same trap like everybody
1212320	1215260	else a million times you said over and over, I want to
1215260	1217300	get the deal done, security is so easy.
1217300	1220000	That's about 2 percent of the problem.
1220000	1221440	I'm not worried about security.
1221440	1223740	I'm worried about getting the deal done.
1223740	1225340	The security is the easy part.
1225340	1226700	Security is very nice.
1226700	1228480	Everybody stop shooting.
1228480	1230040	And now, will Europe put people there?
1230040	1231880	I know France is going to.
1231880	1233920	I know the UK is going to.
1233920	1235920	I know other countries are going to, and they happen
1235920	1237280	to be right next door.
1237280	1239360	We haven't committed, but we could conceivably.
1239360	1241760	You know, we have security in a different form.
1241760	1245100	We'll have workers there digging, digging, digging,
1245100	1248860	taking the raw earth so that we can create a lot of
1248860	1251640	great product in this country.
1251640	1253240	So, in that sense, you have something.
1253240	1255240	But we haven't determined that yet.
1255240	1258380	I will say, in speaking to France and in speaking to
1258380	1261320	the, and they were here, as you know, last week and
1261320	1267080	just the other day, they have committed to a lot of security.
1267080	1268660	I don't think you're going to need much security.
1268660	1271260	I think once this deal gets done, it's over.
1271260	1273640	Russia is not going to want to go back and nobody's
1273640	1274840	going to want to go back.
1274840	1277500	When this, when this deal ends, I really believe this
1277500	1279640	deal is, is going to be over.
1279640	1280980	Question.
1280980	1281540	Yeah.
1281540	1282300	Please go ahead.
1282300	1283080	Go ahead, please.
1283080	1283480	Yeah.
1283480	1284680	The Press, President, thank you.
1284680	1285580	The Press, President, thank you.
1285580	1286840	The Press, President Macron and Keir Starmer at the
1286840	1289220	White House this past week, both whom praised your
1289220	1292080	courage and conviction to lead the pathway towards peace.
1292080	1293760	The Press, President Macron and Keir Starmer
1293760	1294580	Thank you.
1294580	1295580	Part of that involved, though, reengaging with Russia
1295580	1297760	in diplomatic relations, something that previous leaders
1297760	1299420	lack the conviction to do so.
1299420	1301500	What gave you the moral courage and conviction
1301500	1302860	to step forward and lead that?
1302860	1304860	The President Biden Well, I love this guy.
1304860	1305800	Who are you with?
1305800	1306700	The Press 1 American News, sir.
1306700	1308340	The President Biden Well, that's why I like him.
1308340	1310180	One American News does a great job.
1310180	1312180	It's very, I like the question.
1312180	1313900	I think it's a very good question.
1313900	1316180	It is, it's a pathway to peace.
1316180	1319480	It's a pathway to getting something solved.
1319480	1321560	And I feel that as the head of this country,
1321560	1323420	I have an obligation to do that.
1323420	1325660	Plus, you know, we're very much involved.
1325660	1328160	We got involved.
1328160	1330160	It's too bad we got involved because there should have
1330160	1332700	been no involvement because there should have been no war.
1332700	1335060	And there shouldn't have been October 7th.
1335060	1336180	That would have never happened.
1336180	1337980	As you know, Iran was broke.
1337980	1339880	They had no money to give to Hezbollah.
1339880	1342180	They had no money to give to Hamas.
1342180	1344480	They were stone cold broke.
1344480	1347640	And then under Biden, they became rich as hell.
1347640	1352820	They went from no money to $300 billion in a period
1352820	1354480	of four years.
1354480	1356080	And they gave a lot of that money away.
1356080	1357120	And you see what happened.
1357120	1361560	And that's a real mess also that we hope to be able to solve.
1361560	1364420	But, no, I appreciate your question very much.
1364420	1368460	I just, I feel I have an obligation to try and do
1368460	1370960	something to stop the death.
1370960	1372660	The President Trump Jr.: If I can, if I can answer.
1372660	1373860	Yes, if I can answer.
1373860	1374660	The President Trump Jr.: Please, go ahead.
1374660	1375940	The President Trump Jr.: Please, please.
1375940	1377440	The President Trump Jr.: And I do like your clothing, by the way.
1377440	1378300	The President Trump Jr.: Yeah, really?
1378300	1379400	The President Trump Jr.: Even though I have to,
1379400	1380980	I think he's a great guy, by the way.
1380980	1382780	The President Trump Jr.: And I don't know if you two like
1382780	1383580	each other.
1383580	1384520	But you know what?
1384520	1386020	The President Trump Jr.: I think he's dressed beautiful.
1386020	1386760	I like this guy.
1386760	1387260	I don't like him.
1387260	1388060	The President Trump Jr.: I think he's dressed beautifully.
1388060	1391800	The President Trump Jr.: So I have more serious things than
1391800	1392700	answer on such question.
1392700	1393520	The President Trump Jr.: That's true.
1393520	1394700	The President Trump Jr.: I will answer on more serious
1394700	1395920	questions if I can.
1395920	1396460	The President Trump Jr.: That's a good statement.
1396460	1397100	The President Trump Jr.: Yeah.
1397100	1398100	So, please.
1398100	1401900	about security guarantees and about justice fire.
1401900	1405180	We can't just speak about this fire and speak and speak.
1405180	1406680	It will not work.
1406680	1408940	Justice fire will not never work
1408940	1410980	because I'm like a president.
1410980	1414180	I have this experience and not only me.
1414180	1417560	Ukraine, before my presidency from the 2014,
1417560	1421120	Putin broken 25 times.
1421120	1426620	25 times he broken his own signature.
1426620	1428520	Twenty-five times he broken his fire.
1428520	1430060	But he never broke to me.
1430060	1430800	He never broke to me.
1430800	1432400	No, no, you were the president.
1432400	1434360	He never broke to me.
1434360	1437540	In 2016, you've been the president, Mr. President.
1437540	1441240	You've been the president, but he had, of course, not with you,
1441240	1443500	but he had, during those periods,
1443500	1445980	he had conversations with our side,
1445980	1448040	and we had Normandy format, you know,
1448040	1450340	the France, Germany, Ukraine, and Russia,
1450340	1452380	and he broken 25 times.
1452380	1456380	That's why we will never accept just his fire.
1456380	1458980	It will not work without security guarantees.
1458980	1461920	Security guarantees, maybe the president is right
1461920	1463980	about this document and other,
1463980	1465720	but this document is not enough.
1465720	1469060	Strong army is enough because his soldiers are afraid.
1469060	1471260	Putin's soldiers are afraid of our soldiers
1471260	1472500	when we're strong enough.
1472500	1475260	If we are not strong enough, if we are empty,
1475260	1479640	if our storage is empty, we can't defend our land.
1479640	1482240	Today, you know, he knows that we have,
1482240	1484640	all the world knows that we have meeting, yes?
1484640	1486720	Why he's using ballistic?
1486720	1489420	Putin today using ballistic on our hospitals,
1489420	1491920	schools, and et cetera, ballistic.
1491920	1493480	So he knows that we are here,
1493480	1495360	and that President Trump is really,
1495360	1499160	have good will to stop, to stop this war.
1499160	1501720	And you hear now, the president,
1501720	1504600	so why he's using, so he doesn't want to stop.
1504600	1506860	He doesn't want, but I hope that we will do it,
1506860	1508160	really, we'll do it.
1508160	1510860	Security, when we speak about security guarantees,
1510860	1514160	when the Europeans are ready for contingents,
1514160	1518000	they need USA backstop.
1518000	1519840	If there will not be United States,
1519840	1521940	we will never have any contingents,
1521940	1523980	strong contingents from the Europeans,
1523980	1526280	because they don't want to divide alliance,
1526280	1528340	connection between the United States,
1528340	1532760	the main and strongest alliance, and Europeans.
1532760	1534820	This is crucial, this is important.
1534820	1537760	That's what we want to speak about very much.
1537760	1538960	This is very important.
1538960	1542960	And air defense, so air defense,
1542960	1545540	really we have big deficits with all the systems,
1545540	1549500	and we need to provide this, we need it very much.
1549500	1552240	Otherwise, Putin will never stop,
1552240	1553700	and we'll go further and further.
1553700	1556580	He doesn't want, he'll hate us, you know?
1556580	1558720	It's not about me, he hates Ukrainians.
1558720	1561360	He thinks that we are not a nation.
1561360	1563220	He thinks, and he shares this source,
1563220	1565380	I think maybe with your team also, I don't know.
1565380	1568820	But with all the Europeans in media, officially and not,
1568820	1573860	he always said that there is no such country, such nation,
1573860	1577100	such language, and such life like Ukrainian.
1577100	1581320	No, he really doesn't respect all the Ukrainians,
1581320	1584940	and he wants to destroy us.
1584940	1589140	And you are right, Mr. President, that's 2%.
1589140	1591780	This document, maybe other documents.
1591780	1593720	It's a very good start, very good,
1593720	1597920	but it will not enough to stop this person.
1597920	1598980	Should Russia pay to...
1598980	1601860	Mr. President, may I have one more question, please?
1601860	1602680	Yeah, go ahead.
1602680	1603680	I asked the President...
1603680	1605020	They have to pay this question.
1605020	1607720	This is the rule, this is the rule of the war.
1607720	1609320	This is the rule of the war.
1609320	1611460	During all the centuries, all the history,
1611460	1612900	this is the rule of the war.
1612900	1616600	Who began those pay?
1616600	1617400	This is the rule.
1617400	1618780	Putin began this war.
1618780	1621380	He has to pay all money for innovation.
1621380	1622480	He has to pay.
1622480	1624240	Of course, some Russian assets,
1624240	1628820	what we have in Europe, about 300 billions,
1628820	1630480	we can use them.
1630480	1631680	We can use it for innovation
1631680	1634760	and buy military support from the United States also.
1634760	1637620	We can do it, but it's not enough.
1637620	1638620	It's not enough.
1638620	1643260	I asked this question that you didn't like because I wanted to know...
1643260	1645120	Go ahead, please, wait one second.
1645120	1647520	I asked this question that you didn't like
1647520	1651200	because I wanted to know if you want to position yourself
1651200	1655300	in the middle between Russia and Ukraine or on the Ukraine side.
1655300	1656540	No, I'm in the middle.
1656540	1657780	I want to solve this thing.
1657780	1659300	I'm for both.
1659300	1661080	I want to get it solved.
1661080	1666380	And it's wonderful to speak badly about somebody else,
1666380	1668620	but I want to get it solved.
1668620	1669980	If we can solve it, great.
1669980	1672260	If we can't solve it, they're going to have to fight it out
1672260	1674580	and who knows what's going to happen.
1674580	1676420	But I want to see it get solved.
1676420	1677600	May I follow up?
1677600	1680720	One more question about U.S. troops in Europe.
1680720	1684300	After the Russian invasion of Ukraine,
1684300	1687440	your predecessor sent additional troops to Eastern Europe,
1687440	1689140	including Poland, my country.
1689140	1689740	Yeah.
1689740	1693540	Are you committed to keeping these troops
1693540	1698840	on the eastern flank of NATO in the future?
1698840	1701020	I'm very committed to Poland.
1701020	1703080	I think Poland has really stepped up
1703080	1704460	and done a great job for NATO.
1704460	1707320	They, as you know, they paid more than they had to.
1707320	1711820	They are one of the finest groups of people I've ever known.
1711820	1713500	I'm very committed to Poland.
1713500	1714120	What about the Baltic?
1714120	1715820	Poland's in a tough neighborhood, you know.
1715820	1718300	What about the Baltics?
1718300	1724000	The Baltics, they got a lot of, it's a tough neighborhood, too.
1724000	1725040	But we're committed.
1725040	1726380	We're going to be very committed.
1726380	1728340	And we're committed to NATO.
1728340	1729640	But NATO has to step up.
1729640	1732380	And the Europeans have to step up more than they have.
1732380	1733820	And I want to see them equalized,
1733820	1736960	because they are in for far less than we're in.
1736960	1739120	And they should be at least equal.
1739120	1740380	You understand that.
1740380	1743360	Why is the United States, we have an ocean in between.
1743360	1745720	Why is the United States in for so much more money,
1745720	1748660	and other things, as Europe?
1748660	1750620	With that being said, and as you said,
1750620	1753160	they've also been obviously very helpful.
1753160	1756060	But we have put in far more than they have.
1756060	1758460	And I think they should equalize.
1758460	1760300	The Pressure on the agenda.
1760300	1762300	The Pressure on the agenda.
1762300	1763880	What changed between the first time
1763880	1766780	that Secretary Besant gave President Zelensky
1766780	1768600	the agreement and today for the signing?
1768600	1770580	The President Obama's agenda.
1770580	1772620	The Pressure on the agenda.
1772620	1773740	The President Obama's agenda.
1773740	1775720	The President Obama's agenda.
1775720	1778760	I didn't think we were going to make a deal.
1778760	1781600	And we ended up making the deal,
1781600	1783100	so that changed.
1783100	1784500	The Pressure on the agenda.
1784500	1786400	What and how do you envision a trilateral summit
1786400	1787440	with President Zelensky ?
1787440	1788440	The President Obama's agenda?
1788440	1789040	The President Obama's agenda.
1789040	1789640	President Obama's agenda.
1789640	1790300	I don't know, but it's-
1790300	1791400	The President Obama's agenda,
1791400	1792100	but they don't like each other, I can tell you that.
1792100	1792800	Okay?
1792800	1793680	The President Obama's agenda
1793680	1794700	versus the Latest Scheune.
1794700	1794780	The President Obama's agenda.
1794780	1795780	The President Obama's agenda.
1795780	1797540	They don't like, okay?
1797540	1799900	The Almost economy.
1799900	1801500	The President Obama's agenda.
1801500	1802380	The President Obama's agenda.
1802380	1803440	The President Obama's agenda shortly thereafter.
1803440	1808480	United States, run by a man that didn't know much.
1808480	1810320	I'm going to be very nice.
1810320	1813120	Run by an incompetent person.
1813120	1814820	Very incompetent person.
1814820	1817320	Should never have allowed this to happen.
1817320	1818160	I've stopped wars.
1818160	1819860	I've stopped many wars.
1819860	1821800	My people will tell you, I stopped wars that nobody
1821800	1822620	ever heard about.
1822620	1825320	I stopped wars before they ever started.
1825320	1828560	You can look at some of the, some of, I could give
1828560	1830440	you a lot of nations that would tell you right now
1830440	1831760	they were probably going to war.
1831760	1834600	I could tell you right now there's a nation thinking
1834600	1837740	about going to war on something that nobody in this
1837740	1839440	room has ever even heard about.
1839440	1841100	Two smaller nations, but big.
1841100	1842680	Still big.
1842680	1845180	And I think I've stopped it.
1845180	1847180	But this should have never happened.
1847180	1849040	The Pressure President, do you want to talk about
1849040	1854040	about any negotiations?
1854040	1857120	First of all, I want really to tell you, and I think
1857120	1860860	that everybody understands that Ukraine, more than
1860860	1863600	Ukrainians, nobody wants to stop this war.
1863600	1866640	But in the future, any negotiations, it's
1866640	1872700	understandable that two sides of the war, not Russia and
1872700	1875140	the United States, because this is not the war between
1875140	1876580	Russia and the United States.
1876580	1879420	This is a war of Russia against Ukraine and
1879420	1880240	Ukrainian people.
1880240	1884740	So these two sides will be at any, anyway, will be at the
1884740	1887220	negotiation, a negotiation table.
1887220	1891720	Then, of course, United States, like the strongest partner of
1891720	1893080	the Ukraine.
1893080	1894760	And, of course, Europe.
1894760	1896420	I think Europe is very important.
1896420	1899020	I want to speak about it with the President.
1899020	1902500	Yes, Europe is very important for us because we really defend
1902500	1903500	Europe for today.
1903500	1908240	All the Europeans really recognize that we are defending
1908240	1911800	the line, and they have real life, and our people are dying.
1911800	1914040	That's why they helped us.
1914040	1916320	And also, it's about the nature.
1916320	1920420	Yes, between, like the President said, you have big, nice
1920420	1921620	ocean.
1921620	1923580	Yes, between us.
1923580	1927400	But if we will not stay, Russia will go further to
1927400	1929560	Baltics and to Poland, by the way.
1929560	1930860	But first to the Baltics.
1930860	1935360	It's understandable for them because they've been in the
1935360	1939140	USSR, you know, they've been one of the republics of the
1939140	1943200	USSR, and Putin wants to bring them back to his empire.
1943200	1944100	It's a fact.
1944100	1947100	And when he will go there, if we will not stay, you will
1947100	1948040	fight.
1948040	1951480	Your American soldiers, it doesn't matter.
1951480	1953580	Do you have ocean or not?
1953580	1955420	Your soldiers will fight.
1955420	1957420	Mr. President, would you be willing to visit Ukraine?
1957420	1960180	The cave or Odessa, which is known to be a 30-year
1960180	1961180	liberal class?
1961180	1962180	The President, it was my question.
1962180	1966180	The President, I don't want to talk about Odessa now.
1966180	1967680	Let's not talk about Odessa.
1967680	1970860	I want to talk about making a deal, getting peace.
1970860	1973000	We don't have to talk about Odessa.
1973000	1975120	But a lot of cities have been destroyed.
1975120	1978040	There are a lot of cities that are not recognizable.
1978040	1979740	There's not a building standing.
1979740	1981740	And a lot of things have happened.
1981740	1983900	Mr. President, you have to come and to look.
1983900	1984740	No, no, no.
1984740	1986500	We have very good cities.
1986500	1988420	Yes, a lot of things have been destroyed.
1988420	1991520	But mostly cities alive.
1991520	1992880	And people work.
1992880	1994220	And children go to school.
1994220	1995480	Sometimes it's very difficult.
1995480	1997860	Sometimes closer to front line.
1997860	2001320	Children have to go to underground schools or online.
2001320	2003020	But we live.
2003020	2004160	Ukraine is fighting.
2004160	2005660	And Ukraine lives.
2005660	2007260	This is very important.
2007260	2009600	And maybe it's Putin is sharing this information
2009600	2012000	that he destroyed us.
2012000	2014840	He lost 700,000 people.
2014840	2018100	700,000 soldiers he lost in Eversi.
2018100	2019300	Yes.
2019300	2023280	Mr. President, when did you last speak with President Putin?
2023280	2024440	Please, go ahead.
2024440	2026640	Mr. When did you last speak with President Putin?
2026640	2027580	And what did he say that he did?
2027580	2028540	A couple of days ago.
2028540	2030620	And what did he tell you that gave you the assurance
2030620	2032280	that he wanted peace?
2032280	2033120	Well, that's what I do.
2033120	2034420	My whole life is deals.
2034420	2037080	I know pretty good.
2037080	2040280	And I really, I've known him for a long time.
2040280	2042380	I've dealt with him for a long time.
2042380	2045080	He had to suffer through the Russia hoax.
2045080	2046260	You know, Russia, Russia, Russia.
2046260	2047420	It was a hoax.
2047420	2048300	It was all Biden.
2048300	2050060	It was nothing to do with him.
2050060	2051500	So he had to suffer through that.
2051500	2054060	And he was able to do that.
2054060	2056200	I think that he wants to make a deal.
2056200	2058800	And he would like to see it end.
2058800	2059500	That's all I do.
2059500	2060100	That's what I do.
2060100	2062300	My whole life, that's what I do is make deals.
2062300	2064640	And I'm in the middle of a mess.
2064640	2066820	Because this is a real mess.
2066820	2068720	It's a very dangerous one.
2068720	2073120	If this doesn't get solved now, it's not going to get solved for a long time.
2073120	2075120	So I hope we're going to get it solved.
2075120	2076000	In the back, please.
2076000	2077000	The Press.
2077000	2078000	The Press.
2078000	2079000	The Press.
2079000	2092980	Well, we actually spoke to him about that yesterday, and we thought they took it very, very much too far.
2092980	2093980	JD was very strong on it.
2093980	2094280	So was I.
2094280	2094880	So was Marco.
2094880	2099280	And we've been speaking to him about it.
2099280	2101280	Marco, would you like to say something about it?
2101280	2107580	Yeah, we have concerns, obviously, with the conduct of various, particularly as it impacts Americans.
2107580	2111280	And there's real concern that American speech, which is online, could fall into the hands of the British or any country's jurisdiction.
2111280	2121280	And so this is a point the Vice President made in Munich, and I think it's a very compelling one that unites us with Europe, as much as anything else, is these shared values, and one of them being free speech.
2121280	2128280	And so Americans are threatened by it. We're going to need to take action in that regard.
2128280	2131280	It's a very important question.
2131280	2138280	We spoke about this in detail with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary and others at lunch yesterday, and I know that they are going to be a very important question.
2138280	2142280	It's a big question.
2142280	2147280	We spoke about this in detail with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary and others at lunch yesterday.
2147280	2155280	And I know that the Secretary of Commerce, Lutnik, followed up in private meetings last night.
2155280	2157280	This is really important.
2157280	2161280	We believe Americans have the right to speak their mind, even if we in this room disagree with them.
2161280	2166280	They have the right to speak their mind in the public square, which is often online these days.
2166280	2172280	And we're going to defend that right as it pertains to American companies and American citizens vigorously if we have to.
2172280	2178280	I do think that under the President's leadership, we're going to find common ground with our friends in the UK on this question.
2178280	2180280	But it remains to be seen.
2180280	2186280	The principle that will guide us is we believe in free speech in this country and we'll fight for it for American citizens.
2186280	2190280	Mr. President, on the deal, is there any other oil and gas component to the deal?
2190280	2191280	Is it all critical?
2191280	2192280	A little bit. We'll see.
2192280	2193280	On LNG?
2193280	2198280	Mr. But we're not really looking for that so much. We've got a lot. We have more than anybody in the world by far.
2198280	2204280	So, no, we're not talking about it too much, but a little bit. I think it affects also. But for the most part, no.
2204280	2213280	And, sir, is there any agreement from Ukraine to purchase US LNG as part of the deal? Or is that on the table at all?
2213280	2215280	Mr. No. We don't need that.
2215280	2220280	Mr. President, I just wanted to ask you about, you just mentioned that you'd spoken to Vladimir Putin a couple of days ago.
2220280	2224280	Just to be clear, that's a new call, not the one that you're talking about.
2224280	2226280	Mr. I've spoken to him on numerous occasions.
2226280	2231280	Okay. And how was the latest call? And what did you discuss? How did it go?
2231280	2233280	Mr. Are you serious with that question?
2233280	2234280	Mr. I am. I'd love to know.
2234280	2237280	Mr. It went well. I think we're going to have a deal.
2237280	2243280	On the minerals deal, Mr. President, some of those minerals are in the east of Ukraine, not far from the front lines.
2243280	2244280	And in areas that Russia's .
2244280	2246280	Mr. A very good question. Thank you so much.
2246280	2249280	Does President Putin withdraw his forces from those areas if there are U.S. interests?
2249280	2257280	Mr. Well, we'll take a look at the time. We have a lot of area. It's a very big area we're talking about. So, we'll take a look. I'll study that, and I'll see.
2257280	2262280	And who would protect those minerals if they are U.S. interests? Would that be a U.S. interest?
2262280	2265280	Mr. They'll be protected. The agreement will protect them.
2265280	2267280	The agreement, yeah. We're signing an agreement.
2267280	2271280	Mr. So, there is a big deal, but what if Russia tries to invade or orders Russian and Russia into a spy?
2271280	2273280	Mr. I just told you, I don't think that's going to happen.
2273280	2275240	And if that were going to happen, I wouldn't make a deal.
2275240	2278720	If I thought that was going to happen, I wouldn't make a deal.
2278720	2282260	You know, they ought to focus on CNN, on survival,
2282260	2285660	not asking me these ridiculous questions.
2285660	2288800	Focus on surviving, because CNN has got such low ratings,
2288800	2291440	I don't think they're going to survive.
2291440	2292660	Let's go.
2292660	2293860	Yeah, please, go ahead.
2293860	2294860	One more.
2294860	2297400	Since I already mentioned Poland,
2297400	2300940	Poland was under Russian control for decades
2300940	2302840	after the Second World War.
2302840	2305600	When I was a kid, I looked at the United States,
2305600	2311040	not only as a most powerful country, richest country in the world,
2311040	2315680	the country that has great music, great movies, great muscle cars,
2315680	2319400	but also as a force for good.
2319400	2321920	Do you, and now I'm talking with my friends in Poland,
2321920	2326860	and they are worried that you align yourself too much with Putin.
2326860	2330360	What's your message for them?
2330360	2333660	Well, if I didn't align myself with both of them,
2333660	2335560	you'd never have a deal.
2335560	2339360	You want me to say really terrible things about Putin,
2339360	2342180	and then say, hi, Vladimir, how are we doing on the deal?
2342180	2343800	That doesn't work that way.
2343800	2345240	I'm not aligned with Putin.
2345240	2346540	I'm not aligned with anybody.
2346540	2348840	I'm aligned with the United States of America,
2348840	2351280	and for the good of the world.
2351280	2354360	I'm aligned with the world, and I want to get this thing over with.
2354360	2356200	You see the hatred he's got for Putin.
2356200	2358740	It's very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate.
2358740	2361440	He's got tremendous hatred, and I understand that,
2361440	2365640	but I can tell you the other side isn't exactly in love with,
2365640	2368040	you know, him either.
2368040	2370180	So it's not a question of alignment.
2370180	2372940	I have to, I'm aligned with the world.
2372940	2374040	I want to get the thing set.
2374040	2376540	I'm aligned with Europe.
2376540	2379480	I want to see if we can get this thing done.
2379480	2380580	You want me to be tough?
2380580	2383120	I could be tougher than any human being you've ever seen.
2383120	2385120	I'd be so tough.
2385120	2386720	But you're never going to get a deal that way.
2386720	2388280	So that's the way it goes.
2388280	2389360	All right, one more question.
2389360	2390720	Yeah, please.
2390720	2391720	The President, I want to respond to this.
2391720	2394620	So, look, for four years in the United States of America,
2394620	2397060	we had a President who stood up at press conferences
2397060	2399400	and talked tough about Vladimir Putin,
2399400	2401400	and then Putin invaded Ukraine
2401400	2404080	and destroyed a significant chunk of the country.
2404080	2407440	The path to peace and the path to prosperity
2407440	2410280	is maybe engaging in diplomacy.
2410280	2412980	We tried the pathway of Joe Biden,
2412980	2415360	of thumping our chest and pretending
2415360	2417920	that the President of the United States' words
2417920	2421120	mattered more than the President of the United States' actions.
2421120	2423020	What makes America a good country
2423020	2425260	is America engaging in diplomacy.
2425260	2426860	That's what President Trump is doing.
2426860	2428660	Can I ask you?
2428660	2429200	Sure.
2429200	2429740	Yeah?
2429740	2430300	Yeah.
2430300	2431100	Okay.
2431100	2436800	So he occupied it, our parts, big parts of Ukraine,
2436800	2440140	parts of East and Crimea.
2440140	2443580	So he occupied it on 2014.
2443580	2448660	So during a lot of years, I'm not speaking about just Biden,
2448660	2452820	but those time was Obama, then President Obama,
2452820	2455020	then President Trump, then President Biden,
2455020	2457620	and now President Trump, and God bless,
2457620	2459660	now President Trump will stop him.
2459660	2462360	But during 2014, nobody stopped him.
2462360	2464260	He just occupied and took.
2464260	2465200	He killed people.
2465200	2466400	You know what the contact line?
2466400	2468200	2015.
2468200	2468900	2014.
2468900	2469640	2014.
2469640	2470300	2014.
2470300	2470900	Yeah, yeah.
2470900	2471640	So he killed-
2471640	2472500	I was not here.
2472500	2472900	Yeah, but-
2472900	2473840	That's exactly right.
2473840	2480640	Yes, but during 2014 till 2022, was the situation the same?
2480640	2484120	That people have been dying on the contact line.
2484120	2485620	Nobody stopped him.
2485620	2488520	You know that we had conversations with him,
2488520	2491360	a lot of conversations, my bilateral conversation,
2491360	2495300	and we signed with him, me, like a new president.
2495300	2499140	In 2019, I signed with him the deal.
2499140	2501940	I signed with him, Macron, and Merkel.
2501940	2504840	We signed a ceasefire, ceasefire.
2504840	2508520	All of them told me that he will never go.
2508520	2512680	We signed him a gas contract, gas contract.
2512680	2516120	Yes, but after that, he broke the ceasefire.
2516120	2519920	He killed our people, and he didn't exchange prisoners.
2519920	2524260	We signed the exchange of prisoners, but he didn't do it.
2524260	2527500	What kind of diplomacy, J.D., you are speaking about?
2527500	2529640	What do you mean?
2529640	2531400	I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy
2531400	2533160	that's going to end the destruction of your country.
2533160	2534300	Yes, but if you are not strong-
2534300	2535880	Mr. President, Mr. President, with respect,
2535880	2538300	I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office
2538300	2540580	and try to litigate this in front of the American media.
2540580	2544040	Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts
2544040	2546920	to the front lines because you have manpower problems.
2546920	2550060	You should be thanking the President for trying to bring it into this conflict.
2550060	2553360	Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have?
2553360	2554660	I have been to-
2554660	2555320	Come once.
2555320	2561620	I have actually watched and seen the stories, and I know that what happens is you bring people,
2561620	2564620	you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President.
2564620	2568140	Do you disagree that you've had problems bringing people into your military?
2568140	2569140	We have problems.
2569140	2573380	Do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America
2573380	2577680	and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?
2577680	2579140	A lot of questions.
2579140	2580320	Let's start from the beginning.
2580320	2581320	Sure.
2581320	2584480	First of all, during the war, everybody has problems.
2584480	2585480	Even you.
2585480	2588360	But you have nice ocean, and don't feel now.
2588360	2590560	But you will feel it in the future.
2590560	2591560	God bless.
2591560	2592560	You don't know that.
2592560	2593560	God bless.
2593560	2594900	You will not have a war.
2594900	2596640	Don't tell us what we're going to feel.
2596640	2598200	We're trying to solve a problem.
2598200	2599800	Don't tell us what we're going to feel.
2599800	2600800	I'm not telling you.
2600800	2601800	I'm not saying on this question.
2601800	2602800	Because you're in no position to dictate that.
2602800	2603800	Remember this.
2603800	2607980	You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel.
2607980	2609480	We're going to feel very good.
2609480	2610680	You will feel influenced.
2610680	2612980	We're going to feel very good and very strong.
2612980	2613980	I'm telling you.
2613980	2614980	You will feel influenced.
2614980	2616720	You're right now not in a very good position.
2616720	2620660	You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position, and he happens to be right about it.
2620660	2623720	From the very beginning of the war, Mr. President, you're not in a good position.
2623720	2626480	You don't have the cards right now.
2626480	2627480	With us, you start having cards.
2627480	2628480	I'm not playing cards.
2628480	2629480	But right now, you don't.
2629480	2630480	You're playing cards.
2630480	2631480	I'm very serious, Mr. President.
2631480	2632480	You're playing cards.
2632480	2633480	I'm very serious.
2633480	2634480	I'm the president in war.
2634480	2635480	You're gambling with the lives of millions of people.
2635480	2636480	You're gambling with World War III.
2636480	2637480	What else?
2637480	2638480	What are you thinking about?
2638480	2640540	You're gambling with World War III.
2640540	2644540	And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country.
2644540	2645540	This country.
2645540	2646540	It's back to you.
2646540	2647540	I'm with all respect to your country.
2647540	2649540	Far more than a lot of people said they should have.
2649540	2651540	Have you said thank you once this entire meeting?
2651540	2652540	A lot of times.
2652540	2657160	So, in this entire meeting that you said thank you, you went to Pennsylvania and campaigned
2657160	2659500	for the opposition in October.
2659500	2663840	Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's
2663840	2666300	trying to save your country.
2666300	2668440	Please.
2668440	2672300	You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war, you can speak.
2672300	2673300	He's not speaking loudly.
2673300	2674920	He's not speaking loudly.
2674920	2676040	Your country is in big trouble.
2676040	2677040	Can I answer?
2677040	2678040	Wait a minute.
2678040	2679040	There's a lot of talking.
2679040	2680660	Your country is in big trouble.
2680660	2681660	I know.
2681660	2682660	I know.
2682660	2683660	You're not winning.
2683660	2684660	You're not winning this.
2684660	2687660	You have a damn good chance of coming out okay because of us.
2687660	2689340	Mr. President, we are staying in our country.
2689340	2692000	Staying strong from the very beginning of the war.
2692000	2693220	We've been alone.
2693220	2694220	And we are thankful.
2694220	2695220	I said thanks.
2695220	2696220	You haven't been alone.
2696220	2697220	Not only in this cabinet.
2697220	2701220	We gave you, through the stupid president, $350 billion.
2701220	2702220	You voted for your president.
2702220	2703220	We gave you military equipment.
2703220	2704220	You voted for your president.
2704220	2705220	And you men are brave.
2705220	2706220	But they had to use our military.
2706220	2707220	Yes.
2707220	2708220	What about West?
2708220	2709220	If you didn't have our military equipment.
2709220	2710220	You invited me.
2710220	2711220	You invited me to speak.
2711220	2715220	If you didn't have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.
2715220	2716220	In three days.
2716220	2717220	I heard it from Putin.
2717220	2718220	In three days.
2718220	2719220	This is something new.
2719220	2720220	Maybe less.
2720220	2721220	In two weeks.
2721220	2722220	Of course, yes.
2722220	2724220	It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this.
2724220	2726220	I tell you, just say thank you.
2726220	2729220	I said a lot of times thank you to American people.
2729220	2731220	Except that there are disagreements.
2731220	2736220	And let's go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it out in the American
2736220	2737220	media when you're wrong.
2737220	2738220	We know that you're wrong.
2738220	2742220	But you see, I think it's good for the American people to see what's going on over here.
2742220	2743220	I think it's very important.
2743220	2745220	That's why I kept this going so long.
2745220	2747220	You have to be thankful.
2747220	2748220	You don't have the cards.
2748220	2749220	I'm thankful.
2749220	2750220	You're buried there.
2750220	2752220	Your people are dying.
2752220	2753220	I can tell you.
2753220	2754220	You're running low on soldiers.
2754220	2755220	I know.
2755220	2756220	Don't, please.
2756220	2757220	You're running low on soldiers.
2757220	2758220	It would be a damn good thing.
2758220	2759220	Mr. President.
2759220	2761220	Then you tell us, I don't want a ceasefire.
2761220	2762220	I don't want a ceasefire.
2762220	2763220	I want to go.
2763220	2764220	And I wanted this.
2764220	2769220	Look, if you could get a ceasefire right now, I'd tell you, you'd take it.
2769220	2772220	So the bullets stop flying and your men stop getting killed.
2772220	2773220	Of course, we want to stop the war.
2773220	2774220	But I said to you.
2774220	2775220	But I said to you.
2775220	2776220	With guarantees.
2776220	2777220	With guarantees.
2777220	2779220	Because you'll get a ceasefire faster than an agreement.
2779220	2781220	Ask our people about ceasefire.
2781220	2782220	What do they think?
2782220	2784220	It doesn't matter for you what it means.
2784220	2785220	It wasn't with me.
2785220	2786220	It wasn't with you.
2786220	2789220	That was with a guy named Biden, who was not a smart person.
2789220	2790220	That was with Obama.
2790220	2791220	This is your president.
2791220	2792220	It was your president.
2792220	2793220	Excuse me.
2793220	2795220	That was with Obama, who gave you sheets.
2795220	2796220	And I gave you javelins.
2796220	2797220	Yes.
2797220	2800220	I gave you the javelins to take out all those tanks.
2800220	2802220	Obama gave you sheets.
2802220	2807220	In fact, the statement is, Obama gave sheets and Trump gave javelins.
2807220	2810220	You got to be more thankful.
2810220	2812220	Because let me tell you, you don't have the cards.
2812220	2814220	With us, you have the cards.
2814220	2816220	But without us, you don't have any cards.
2816220	2819220	One more question to Mr. Vice President.
2819220	2820220	I'm sorry.
2820220	2822220	It's going to be a tough deal to make.
2822220	2824220	Because the attitudes have to change.
2824220	2827220	What if Russia breaks this fire?
2827220	2829220	What if Russia breaks these talks?
2829220	2830220	What do you do then?
2830220	2834220	I understand that it's a heated conversation right now.
2834220	2835220	What are you saying?
2835220	2838220	She's asking what if Russia breaks the ceasefire?
2838220	2840220	What if they, what if anything?
2840220	2843220	What if a bomb drops on your head right now?
2843220	2844220	Okay?
2844220	2845220	What if they broke it?
2845220	2846220	I don't know.
2846220	2847220	They broke it with Biden.
2847220	2849220	Because Biden, they didn't respect him.
2849220	2850220	They didn't respect Obama.
2850220	2852220	They respect me.
2852220	2855220	Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me.
2855220	2858220	He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia,
2858220	2860220	Russia, Russia, Russia.
2860220	2861220	You ever hear of that deal?
2861220	2866220	That was a phony, that was a phony Hunter Biden, Joe Biden scam.
2866220	2869220	Hillary Clinton, Shifty Adam Schiff.
2869220	2871220	It was a Democrat scam.
2871220	2873220	And he had to go through that.
2873220	2874220	And he did go through it.
2874220	2876220	We didn't end up in a war.
2876220	2877220	And he went through it.
2877220	2878220	He was accused of all that stuff.
2878220	2879220	He had nothing to do with it.
2879220	2881220	It came out of Hunter Biden's bathroom.
2881220	2886220	It came out of Hunter Biden's bedroom.
2886220	2888220	It was disgusting.
2888220	2894220	And then they said, oh, oh, the laptop from hell was made by Russia.
2894220	2896220	The 51 agents.
2896220	2898220	The whole thing was a scam.
2898220	2899220	And he had to put up with that.
2899220	2901220	He was being accused of all that stuff.
2901220	2903220	All I can say is this.
2903220	2907220	He might have broken deals with Obama and Bush.
2907220	2909220	And he might have broken them with Biden.
2909220	2910220	He did, maybe.
2910220	2911220	Maybe he didn't.
2911220	2912220	I don't know what happened.
2912220	2913220	But he didn't break them with me.
2913220	2914220	He wants to make a deal.
2914220	2916220	I don't know if you can make a deal.
2916220	2920220	The problem is, I've empowered you to be a tough guy.
2920220	2924220	And I don't think you'd be a tough guy without the United States.
2924220	2926220	And your people are very brave.
2926220	2929220	But you're either going to make a deal or we're out.
2929220	2932220	And if we're out, you'll fight it out.
2932220	2934220	I don't think it's going to be pretty.
2934220	2935220	But you'll fight it out.
2935220	2937220	But you don't have the cards.
2937220	2941220	But once we sign that deal, you're in a much better position.
2941220	2943220	But you're not acting at all thankful.
2943220	2944220	And that's not a nice thing.
2944220	2945220	I'll be honest.
2945220	2946220	That's not a nice thing.
2946220	2947220	All right.
2947220	2949220	I think we've seen enough.
2949220	2950220	What do you think?
2950220	2953220	This is going to be great television.
2953220	2954220	I will say that.
2954220	2956220	All right.
2956220	2959220	We'll see what we can do about putting it together.
2959220	2961220	Thank you.
2961220	2962220	Thanks.
